• R0 resection rate -  defined as the proportion of patients with R0 resection in an EE 
analysis set.  
• 1-year/3 -year Disease- Free S urvival (DFS) rate -  defined as the proportion of patients 
free from disease events at 1st year  and 3rd year aft er the first date of no disease  in an 
EE analysis set . DFS is defined as the time from the first date of no disease to local or 
distant recurrence or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. DFS rate will be 
analyzed only for patients who under go R0  resection.  
• 1-year/3 -year Event -Free S urvival (EFS) rate -  defined as the proportion of patients 
free from progression event s (EFS events ) at 1st year 3rd year after the first dose  in an 
EE analysis set . EFS is defined as the time from the time of first dose until any of the

 Tislelizumab 3 cycles + i nvestigator -chosen chemotherapy doublet (Paclitaxel + 
Cisplatin/5 -Fu + Cisplatin) 2 cycles + concurrent radiotherapy (40 Gy/20 F).  
Surgery:  
Upon completion of neoadjuvant therapy, patients will undergo surgical resection of tumor 
after reassessment to reconfirm disease resectability. Surgical specimens will be assessed for 
pathological response (MPR and pCR).  
The surgical procedure should be performed within 4 -6 weeks from the last administered dose 
of chemotherapy treatment (the last dose of chemo radiotherapy in Cohort B).

1.1. Background Information on Esophageal Carcinoma  
Esophageal cancer is the seventh  most common cancer worldwide (572,000 new cases) and the 
sixth most common cause of death (509,000 deaths)  from cancer ( (Bray et al 2019). The 
incidence, prevalence, and histologic type of esophageal cancer var y between geographic regions 
(Arnold et al 2015), a pproximately 75% of all cases occur in Asia with China bearing the largest 
burden, accounting for about 50% of total cases and cancer -specific deaths. In China, esophageal 
cancer is the third most common cancer and the fourth l eading cause of death from cancer, based 
on an estimation of 477,900 new esophagus cancer cases and 375,000 deaths from this disease 
expected in 2015 ( Chen et al 2016) .  
Two most common histologic s ubtypes ( esophageal s quamous c ell carcinoma [ ESCC]  and 
adenocarcinoma have quite different etiologies. Heavy drinking and smoking and their 
synergistic effects are the major risk factors for SCC in Western settings ( Blot et al 2017) . 
However, in low -income  countries, such as in parts of Asia and Sub- Saharan Africa, the major 
risk factors for ESCC (which usually comprises over 90% of all esophageal cancer cases) have 
yet to be elucidated.  
In the early and locally advanced stages, esophagectomy is recognized as the curative treatment . 
However, for patients with  locally advanced ESCC, neo -adjuvant therapy followed by surgery 
showed a better clinical benefit compared with surgery only ( Joel et al 2015 ). But prognostic f or 
locally advanced ESCC is  still poor, f rom 2009 to 2015, the overall 5- year relative survival rate 
for esophageal cancer ( EC) was 21.4% , and t he corresponding 5- year relative survival rates were 
46.7% for localized cancer , 25.1% for regional  metastasis , 4.8% for distant  metastasis ( Noone et",20,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf
38,"46.7% for localized cancer , 25.1% for regional  metastasis , 4.8% for distant  metastasis ( Noone et 
al 2017) . Poor prognostic factors for survival in patients with ESCC include advanced stage of 
disease at the initial diagnosis, poor performance s tatus, and malnutrition wit h unintentional 
weight loss , etc.  
1.2. Current Treatment of Resectable Esophageal Carcinoma and Unmet 
Clinical Needs  
For patients with early stage of ESCC (pTis, T1a, T1b, N0), resection is a recommended 
modality, which includes endos copic therapies and esophagectomy;  for patients with locally 
advanced ESCC, preoperative  chemoradiation followed by esophagectomy is recommended by 
international treatment guidelines  ((NCCN) Guidelines Version 4, 2020) . Postoperative 
chemotherapy or chemoradiation is commonly given to patients who have positive lymph nodes 
after R0 resection, or to those with microscopic or macrosc opic residual cancer (R1 and R2 
resection, respectively) after surgery.  
The status of preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy as standard of care for ESCC is based 
on the CROSS study ( van et al 2008) , which demonstrated overall survival benefit  with 
neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery compared with surgery alone. 
Long- term results of  the CROSS study ( Joel et al 2015)  showed that , median overall survival has 
been prolonged from 24.0 m onths to 48.6 m onths ; and for patients with ESCC, median overall 
survival has been prolonged from 21.1 m onths to 81.6 months. Another study, NEOCRTEC5010 
(Hong et al 2018)   showed a similar trend, median overall survival was 100.1 months in neo -",20,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy ( cCRT ) followed by surgery group versus 66.5 months 
in surgery alone group.  
In the preoperative setting for locally advanced esophageal cancer, preoperative c hemotherapy 
also shows survival benefits compared with surgery alone. In the Medical Research Council 
OEO2 T rial (Allum et al 2009 ), median survival was 16.8 months in the preoperative 
chemotherapy group compared with 13.3 months in the surgery alone group, and the 2- year 
survival rates were 43% and 34%, respectively; Long -term follow -up confirmed the survival 
bene fit of preoperative chemotherapy, with a 23% 5- year survival rate in the preoperative 
chemotherapy group compared with  17.1% in the surgery alone group. Although the benefit for 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not as great as for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, a clear 
advantage of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy over neoadjuvant chemotherapy has not been 
established and further trials are warranted.  (Shown in Table2 ). In previous studies, although no 
difference has been demonstrated between the treatment groups in the frequency of postoperative 
complications, complications were significantly more severe in the (neoadjuvant 
chemoradiotherapy ) nCRT arm, for example, incre ased the numbers of postoperative deaths 
(Klevebro et al 2016; Stahl et al 2017) . 
However, in clinical practice, because of safety concerns on adding radiotherapy to neo -adjuvant 
therapy and difficulties in collaborations cross  clinical departments, patients with locally 
advanced ESCC  who  received preoperative chemotherapy rather than preoperative 
chemoradiotherapy may not receive the full ben efit of neoadjuvant treatment.  Other checkpoint 
inhibitors have data to suggest that adding immune -therapy and radiation to neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy can improve clinical outcomes .",21,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf

data in PET -guided Studies  (Buschenfelde  et al  2011;  Greally et al 2018 ’ Ilson 2012)  (shown in 
Table 3) . After induction therapy, patients were divide d into  PET responder s (SUVmax ≥  35% ) 
and non- responder s (SUVmax <  35%), pCR rates of 21.9- 31.8% and 4 -13.6% were observed in 
responders and non- responders who underwent surgery , respectively . Regarding the OS and PFS, 
PET- CT responder s showed  a median PFS  of 24.7- 70 months and a  median OS of 40.2- 85 
months , while  non res ponder s show ed a poor er prognosis with a m edian PFS of 7- 7.7 months 
and a m edian OS of 17 -25.5 months . Therefore, improving the survival benefit for the population 
of PET -CT non- responder s is also an unmet medical need .

1.4. Background Information on Tislelizumab  
1.4.1. Pharmacology 
Tislelizumab (also known as BGB -A317) is a humanized, immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) -variant 
monoclonal antibody against programmed cell death protein- 1 (PD -1) under clinical 
development for the treatment of several human malignancies.  
Tislelizumab acts by bindi ng to the extracellular domain of human PD -1 with high specificity as 
well as high affinity (dissociation constant [K D] = 0.15 nM).  It competitively blocks binding 
efforts by both programmed cell death protein ligand- 1 (PD -L1) and programmed cell death 
protein ligand- 2 (PD -L2), thus inhibiting PD -1-mediated negative signaling in T cells.  In in vitro 
cell-based assays, tislelizumab was observed to consistently and dose -dependently enhance the 
functional activity of human T cells and pre -activated, primary peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells.  Tislelizumab has demonstrated in  vivo antitumor activity in several allogeneic xenograft 
models, in which peripheral blood mononuclear cells were co- injected with human cancer cells 
(A431 [epidermoid carcinoma]) or tumor fragments (BCCO -028 [colon cancer]) into 
immunocompromised mice.  
Tislelizumab is an IgG4 -variant antibody to gamma fragment crystallizable region (Fc) receptors 
(FcγR) such as FcγRI and FcγRIIIA, and it has very low binding affinity to Complement 1q 
(C1q ), a subunit of complement 1. In vitro assays with tislelizumab suggest either low or no 
antibody- dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody- dependent cellular phagocytosis",25,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf

Zhang et al 2018) .  Tislelizumab was specifically engineered to abrogate these potential 
mechanisms of T -cell clearance and potential resistance to anti -PD-1 therapy. 
Please refer to the Tislelizumab  Investigator’s Brochure  for additional details regarding 
nonclinical studies of tislelizumab.  
1.4.2. Toxicology 
The toxicity and safety profile of tislelizumab was characterized in single -dose toxicology 
studies in mice and cynomolgus monkeys and in a 13- week, repeat -dose toxicology study in 
cynomolgus monkeys.  Tissue cross -reactivity was evaluated in normal frozen t issues from both 
humans and monkeys.  The cytokine release assays were conducted using fresh human whole 
blood cells.  The pivotal toxicology studies were conducted following Good Laboratory Practice 
(GLP) regulations.  The single -dosing regimens spanned f rom the intended human doses to 10-
fold higher than the maximum of the intended human doses, and the repeat -dosing regimens 
spanned to 3- fold higher than the maximum of the intended human doses.  Cynomolgus monkey 
was the only relevant species based on the  target sequence homology and binding activity. 
Overall, no apparent toxicity was noted in mice or monkey toxicity studies.  No tissue 
cross -reactivity was found in either human or monkey tissues, nor was any effect on cytokine 
release observed in the human whole -blood assay.  The toxicokinetic profile was well 
characterized, with dose proportional increases in systemic exposure without apparent 
accumulation or sex difference.  Immunogenicity was observed without apparent 
immunotoxicity or effect on the sys temic exposure.  The No Observed Adverse Effect Level 
(NOAEL) of tislelizumab in the 13 -week monkey toxicity study was considered to be 30 mg/kg.",26,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf

toxicology of tislelizumab. 
1.4.3. Clinical Pharmacology  
Population PK analysis was conducted using data from 798 patients with solid tumors or 
classical Hodgkin lymphoma who r eceived doses of 0.5, 2.0, 5.0, and 10 mg/kg once every 
2 weeks, 2.0 and 5.0 mg/kg once every 3 weeks, and 200 mg once every 3 weeks.  The PK of 
tislelizumab was best characterized using a 3 -compartmental linear population PK model with 
linear clearance me chanisms.  No time -varying clearance was observed in tislelizumab PK.  The 
typical estimates of clearance (CL), central volume (V c), and peripheral volumes (V 2, V3), were 
0.164 L/day, 2.92 L, 0.928 L, and 1.39 L, respectively, with moderate inter -individua l variability 
in CL (32.2%), V c (16.7%), V 2 (56.6%), and V 3 (94.2%).  The volume of distribution at steady 
state (Vss) was 5.238 L, which is typical of monoclonal antibodies with limited distribution, 
which is consistent with a standard immunoglobulin G (I gG) monoclonal antibody ( (Deng R et al 
2012)  ; Dirks NLet al 2010; Keizer RJ et al 2020 ; Ryman JT et al 2017 ); .  Based on the 
population PK analysis, tislelizumab PK was characterized by a terminal half -life of 
approximately 25.5 days, which is consistent with other therapeutic IgG monoclonal antibodies. 
Population PK analysis demonstrated that baseline age, race, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate 
aminotransferase, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, estimated  glomerular filtration rate, ECOG",26,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf

classical Hodgkin lymphoma patients did not show statistically significant impact on the PK of 
tislelizumab.  Although tumor size, album in, and tumor type were significant covariates on CL, 
while body weight, sex, and tumor type were significant covariates on V c, these covariates are 
not expected to have a clinically relevant impact on tislelizumab exposure.  Exposure -response 
analysis indicated that there was a lack of clinically significant exposure- response relationships 
for objective response rate (ORR) and safety endpoints across a variety of advanced solid tumors 
and classical Hodgkin lymphoma for tislelizumab. Population PK analysis supports fixed- dosing 
across different ethnic groups.

cytotoxicity (ADCC) or antibody- dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) depletion of effector 
T cells ( Gül et al, 2015; Prieto et al 2015; Makarova- Rusher et al, 2015) .  As a no-  to low -FcγR -
binding agent (thus causing minimal ADCC/ADCP effect), tislelizumab may show improved 
efficacy and reduced toxicity in esophageal carcinoma  Available data from a clinical study with 
other anti -PD-1 monoclonal antibodies , nivolumab and pembrolizumab, has shown the drug to 
have both a manageable safety profile and promising antitumor activity in patients with E C 
(Section  1.1). 
Finally, according to the latest data collected from the Phase 1 BGB -A317_Study_001, 
tislelizumab monotherapy has established a manageable safety profile, with the most common 
side effects consistent with known class effects of other anti -PD-1 antibodies. 
1.5.2. Rationale for Selection of Tislelizumab Dose  
The clinical fixed dose of 200 mg intravenously once every 3 weeks was selected based on 
comparable safety and efficacy profiles bet ween 2  and 5 mg/kg in BGB -A317_Study_001:  
• Rates of treatment -related AEs and SAEs observed in patients receiving 2 mg/kg and 
5 mg/kg once every 2 weeks and once every 3 weeks were comparable, suggesting no 
clear dose- dependence across these regimens.  Addi tionally, PK data also showed no 
relationship between exposure and treatment -emergent imAE s (Wu et al 2019 a; Wu 
et al 2019b).  
• Confirmed response rates in patients treated with tislelizumab on a once every 
3 weeks schedule were more favorable compared to those treated on a once every 
2 weeks schedule.  While there are differences in response rates between dose levels, 
this is more likely a reflection of small sample size and patient heterogeneity than 
dose response.",34,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf

this is more likely a reflection of small sample size and patient heterogeneity than 
dose response.  
• Clearance of tislelizumab was not dependent on body weight, and the observed serum 
exposure of a 200 mg dose fell between serum exposure observed after 2  mg/kg and 
5 mg/kg doses. Therefore, clinical activity with a manageable and tolerable safety 
profile is expected to be maintained in patients receiving tislelizumab 200 mg once 
every 3  weeks . 
• Expos ure-response analysis indicated that there was a lack of clinically significant 
exposure -response relationships for ORR and safety endpoints across a variety of 
advanced solid tumors and classical Hodgkin lymphoma for tislelizumab.  These 
findings support 200 mg once every 3  weeks dose regimen for pivotal studies. 
In conclusion, the observed clinical activity in patients with advanced tumors, coupled with a 
manageable safety profile and supportive data, support the proposed tislelizumab dose of 200 mg

determined at screening regardless of PD -L1 expression.  
Esophageal cancer consists of two major histologic subtypes: esophageal squamous cell 
carcinoma (ESCC) and adenocarcinoma (EAC). Both histologic subtypes have distinct risk 
factors and epidemiology, and different response from immunotherapy. ESCC continues to be 
the major subtype of EC in China and showed better response from immunotherapy, which was 
demonstrated in Keynote -181 study, for ITT (Intent to Treated) population, patients with ESCC 
showed a lower HR ( hazard ratio) than patients with EAC. Additional ly, Attraction 3 S tudy 
demonstrated that there was not a significant difference for Hazard Ratio between  patient s with 
PD-L1 ≥  1 and PD -L1 < 1, who were treated with nivol umab as the second -line therapy for 
ESCC , which means even with lower PD -L1 expression, patients may also get potential benefit 
from PD -1 inhibitor therapy. Therefore, this study will focus on resectable locally advanced 
ESCC regardless of PD -L1 expression.  
As in NCCN guidelines Version 4 2020 for esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancers, 
neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is recommended for ESCC with S tage cT1 -2N+M0 or  cT3-
T4aNanyM0. However, in this study, patients in Cohort A will receive neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy rather than chemoradiotherapy, and patients in Cohort B will  receive neoadjuvant 
chemoradiotherapy. To ensure patients’ resectability after neoadjuvant therapy, patients with 
Stage T4a will not be included. Therefore, clinical stage of disease for eligibility is defined as 
cT1-2N+M0 and cT3NanyM0.

could be guided with effective modality (PET), and if neoadjuvant systemic therapy could bring 
similar or better benefit than neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy to patient s with PET response  after 
induction therapy, there may be an  opportunity to avoid radiotherapy for these patients.  
1.5.4. Rationale for Tislelizumab in the Perioperative Treatment of Resectable ESCC  
As discussed in Section 1.3, PD -1 inhibitors have demonstrated significant benefit from 2nd Line 
therapy to 1st Line ESCC and in combination with chemotherapy in a number of early- stage 
solid tumors (Kato 2020; Kojima et al  2019 ; Lee et al 2019 ). Non clinical studies showed that the 
immune -suppressive PD -1 axis is activated early in solid tumor  (Chiari et al, 2018) and induction 
of an immune response before surgery may lead to durable protection. Immunotherapy effects 
could be even better prior to surgery considering that a fter surgical resection, tumor antigens 
decrease dramatically and intact blood vessels and lymph nodes for drug delivery are removed 
which may influence immunotherapy effects. Several Phase1/2 and phase 2 studies showed 
manageable safety profiles and preliminary efficacy when adding PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitor to 
perioperative treatment for patients with resec table EC (Lee et al 2019 ; Ende et al  2019; Uboha 
et al 2019)

of 12.8 months, and median OS of  14.31 months . Additionally, 3 Phase 3 pivotal studies in 
ESCC area are ongoing (Study BGB -A317- 302, BGB -A317- 306, and BGB -A317- 311).  
As discussed in  Section 1.3 , PD-1 inhibitor has already demonstrated significant benefit from 
second -line therapy to first -line therapy . Given the evidence of clinical activity of 
immunotherapy in ESCC patients with advanced disease as well as the need to improve upon 
survival and decrease recurrence rates for patients with resectable early -stage disease, studies 
exploring anticancer activit ies of immunotherapies for the treatment of resectable disease 
emerged in large numbers. Preliminary data indicated promising signal of immunotherapy as 
neo-adjuvant therapy. ( Lee et al 2019 )  
Therefore, adding Tislelizumab to the neoadjuvant phase may be a potential regimen to improve 
benefit for patients with resectable locally advanced ESCC.  
1.5.5. Rationale for Tislelizumab in Combination with  Chemotherapy  for Cohort A  
Patient in Cohort A is the PET responder s (decrease of SUVmax  ≥ 35%) after induction 
chemotherapy . Induction chemotherapy is the first treatment phase in this study. Previous studies 
showed that the use of induction chemotherapy before neoadjuvant cCRT was associated with 
much fewer dis tant relapses, and favorable outcomes in patients with ESCC achieving pCR, and 
there was no significant difference in the rate of postoperative complications of Grade 2 or 
higher between the induction chemotherapy group and noninduction chemotherapy group. (Lu  
et al 2019; Satake et al  2013)

As discussed in  Section 1.3.2, interim analysis from Keynote -590 S tudy ( Kato et al 2020 )  
showed promising efficacy dat a for the ESCC population treated with pembrolizumab in 
combination with chemotherapy. As discussed in Section 1.3.1, Study BGB -A317- 205 ( Xu et al 
2020) showed Tislelizumab in combination with chemotherapy demonstrated preliminary 
efficacy and safety data. Based on the improvement of clinical benefit, Tislelizumab in 
combination with chemotherapy could be respected to synergistic antitumor activity for patients 
with locally advanced ESCC.  
In a subsequent review of therapeutic PET response in patients with ESCC who received 
preoperative chemotherapy, patients with a complete metabolic response fo llowing 
chemotherapy had improved clinical benefit (Yanagawa et al, 2012 ). Clinical evidence suggested 
PET responders ha d similar efficacy compared with patients who received cCRT. And safety 
profile favored that neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be a potential acc eptable modality.  
Therefore, it  is expected that patients with PET response s are supposed to achieve a similar 
benefit from the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (radiotherapy free) as the traditional neoadjuvant 
cCRT, and additional toxicities related to radiation  could be avoided. In addition, shifting the 
immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy to earlier treatment setting may further 
improve pathological response and outcome.  
1.5.6. Rationale for Tislelizumab in Combination with  CRT for Cohort B

still very poor ( Buschenfelde et al 2011; Greally et al  2018; Ilson et al 2012).  
It is now known that both chemotherapy and radiotherapy can upregulate the expression of PD -
L1 ((Zhang et al 2008; Deng et al 2014)) due to the release of cytokines and other inflammatory 
molecules, which could make such tumors sensitive to a PD -1/PD -L1 directed therapy. 
Elimination of cancer cells by chemoradiotherapy triggers release of antigens, which can turn 
poorly immunogenic or immunosuppressive tumors into an immunogenic environment 
(Vanneman et al 2012) . In addition, radiotherapy has an impact on the immune system by 
engaging both the innate and the adaptive arms, eliciting tumor -specific T -cells and establishing 
an immune memory against the tumor. This prolongs the effect of radiation, improving 
locoregional control, decreasing metastatic spread, an d increasing OS ( Formenti et al 2013) . 
Several early -stage studies have demonstrated preliminary antitumor activity and clinical benefit 
from PD -1 inhibitor in combination with neoadjuvant CRT. As discussed in Section 1.3.2, NCT 
02844075 ( Lee et al 2019 ), a phase 2 trial of preoperative chemoradiotherapy and 
Pembrolizumab , in which the re sult showed that pCR rate was 23.1%  for ypT0N0 and 46.1 for 
ypT0, 12- month OS rate was 82.1%, and  12-month EFS rate was 60.3% , and with no new 
toxicity signals observed. Based on the above interactional mechanism between PD -1 inhibitor 
and CRT, and clinical data, adding Tislelizumab to neo- adjuvant CRT may be a  potential 
regimen to improve prognosis for PET non- responder patients .

1.6.1. Benefit -Risk Assessment  of Cohort A  
The use of PET to guide neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with resectable locally advanced 
ESCC, who may benefit from concurrent immunotherapy and chemotherapy similar to standard 
of care ( SOC ) but avoiding receiving radiotherapy in neoadjuvant phase, would meet great 
medical need. The overall safety experience with tislelizumab, as a monotherapy or in 
combination with other therapeutics, is based on experience in 1917 patients treated as of the 
cutoff date 20 May 2020. The safety profile is consistent with the known class effects of anti -
PD-1 antibodies and includes mostly mild/moderate AEs. Grade 3or 4  imAEs have been 
observed and have been generally reversible and manageable with study drug interruption and/or 
steroid treatment. Fatal imAEs are rare. The s afety profiles of combination therapy with 
tislelizumab have been consistent across different platinum -based doublet chemotherapy 
regimens. AEs with potentially immune -mediated  causes consistent with an immunotherapeutic 
agent, including rash, influenza- like symptoms, endocrinopathies, hepatitis or transaminitis, 
pneumonitis, and colitis have been observed. AEs that were most frequently reported with 
combination therapy were generalized symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, and vomiting, as well 
as those s pecific to cytotoxic chemotherapy such as hematologic toxicities and peripheral 
neuropathy. As discussed in  Section 1.3.1 , BGB -A317- 205 study, which enrolled 15 patients

that tislelizumab in combination with chemotherapy has a manageable safety profile. Among the

expected that the PET responder s can have at least similar efficacy outcomes and better 
tolerability by adding tislelizumab to neo -adjuvant chemotherapy comparing with neo -adjuvant

Data from a Phase 2 clinical study of  Pembrolizumab  (Lee et al 2019 ), another anti -PD-1 
antibody, in combination with cCRT  followed by surgery  indicated an increased pCR  rate of 
23.1% for ypT0N0 and 46.1% for ypT0 compared with historical data, and show ed a potential of 
durable response , which suggests the potential efficacy of anti -PD-1 antibodies in combination 
with neo- adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy for patients with locally advanced ESCC  (for 
additional discussion, see  Section  1.3). No treatment discontinuation occurred due to AEs , and 
adding Pembrolizumab to CRT followed by surgery did not show new significant safety signal . 
Considering the extremely poor outcome of patients who did not  respond to PET after induction 
chemotherapy, even if received standard neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, meanwhile,  based on 
the mechanism of synergistic effect between PD -1/PD-L1 inhibitor and chemoradiotherapy, and 
the preliminary efficacy data of PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitors in combination with neoadjuvant 
chem oradiotherapy, it’s expected that PET non- responder can get better efficacy outcome with",38,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf

Induction Phase:  
After completing all screening activities, eligible patients will receive one cycle induction 
therapy of chemotherapy doublet (cisplatin and paclitaxel). (As described in Section 5.2)  
Neoadjuvant Phase:  
All patients will be grouped into two cohorts  based on the  change of PET SUVmax  (15-21 days 
after the last dose of induction therapy) :    
o Cohort A (Responder: decrease in PET SUVmax ≥ 35% ):   
 Tislelizumab 3 cycles + chemotherapy doublet (cisplatin and paclitaxel) 2 cycles  (as 
described in Section 5.2)  
o Cohort B (Non- Responder: decrease in PET SUVmax <  35%): 
 Tislelizumab 3 cycles + chemotherapy doublet 2 cycles + radiotherapy (40Gy/20F)  
Note: Chemotherapy doublets  (Paclitaxel + Cisplatin/5 -Fu + Cisplatin 
(Investigator -chosen) ) (as described in Section 5.2)  
In Cycle 4 (neoadjuvant phase) , Tislelizumab  (without chemotherapy)  will be administered 1 -3 
weeks prior to surgery, which could ensure the exposure dose of Tislelizumab and en ough 
duration for patients to recover from toxicities of chemotherapy/chemoradiotherapy.  
During the neoadjuvant phase, patients who are found to have disease progression assessed  by 
the investigator at any time during neoadjuvant treatment and are still deemed resectable and 
nonmetastatic will proceed to receive surgery and will remain eligible for all on -study 
evaluations based on investigator’s judgement. Patients who discontinue neoadjuvant treatme nt 
early because of disease progression or intolerable AEs and do not proceed to surgery will be 
discontinued from further in- clinic study procedures and will proceed to receive other treatment 
as determined by the investigator. These patients will remain in the study for survival follow -up.

3.6.1. Patient Discontinuation From Study Treatment  
Patients have the right to discontinue study treatment at any time for any reason.  In addition, the 
investigator has the right to discontinue a patient from the study treatment at any time.  Patients 
who discontinue  study treatment for reasons other than disease progression  should be followed 
for assessments of antitumor activ ity (Section  7.5), safety (Section  7.4),  and survival, if possible. 
The primary reason for discontinuation from the study treatment should be documented on the 
appropriate electronic case report form  (eCRF).  Patients may discontinue study treatment for 
reasons which include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• Treatment completed  
• Disease Progression  (radiographic progression or clinical progression as per 
investigator assessment)  
• Adverse event  
• Patient Decision  
• Pregnancy  
• Any medical condition that the investigator or sponsor determines may jeopardize the 
patient’s safety, if he or she were to continue the study treatment  
• Use of any concurrent anticancer therapy  (ie, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, 
immunotherapy, or standa rd or investigational agents  
• Patient noncompliance  
Investigative site staff should first counsel patients who are significantly 
noncompliant (eg, missing 2 treatment cycles) on the importance of study drug 
compliance and drug accountability.  The investig ator may, in consultation with the 
medical monitor, discontinue patients from treatment who are consistently 
noncompliant.

The surgical procedure should be performed within 4- 6 weeks after the last dose of neoadjuvant 
study treatment (in Cohort A, the last dose of chemotherapy; i n Cohort B, the last dose of 
chemoradiotherapy) as best as possible. If surgery cannot be performed within this time window 
(eg, because of a prolonged AE), the investigator and the medical monitor will determine the 
acceptable length of this time window. If surgery is planned beyond 8 weeks after the last dose 
of study treatment, a repeat ed-CT scan sho uld be obtained before the planned surgery. Resection 
may be accomplished via an open or minimally invasive procedure (eg, video- assisted thoracic 
surgery).  
The performed surgical procedure should be documented and reported in the eCRF. If, after

Reasons for dose modifications or delays, the supportive measures taken, and the outcome will 
be documented in the patient's chart and recorded in the eCRF. The severity of AEs will be 
graded according to the NCI -CTCAE v5.0 grading system. The drug- related toxicities should be 
managed according to the prescribing information for the approved product or institutional 
standard practices. The general guidance in this section is for reference of this study:  
 The first doses of chemotherapy are dependent up on the patient ’s baseline body 
weight. Subsequent doses must be recalculated if the change of body weight from 
baseline is  ≥ 10%. Subsequent doses should not be recalculated if the change 
(increase or decrease) of body weight from baseline  is < 10% unless there is 
persistent toxicity that requires dose adjustment. If the dose is recalculated because of 
a ≥ 10% change in body weight from baseline, this body weight will then be used as 
the new baseline to calculate the dose of chemotherapy in subsequent cycle s. 
 In case of chemotherapy -related toxicity, chemotherapy will be delayed until it 
resolves to baseline or ≤ Grade 1 (whichever is more severe) prior to administering 
the next dose of chemotherapy, with the exception of alopecia, Grade 2 fatigue, or 
other AEs which, in the opinion of the investigator, would not affect the safety 
evaluation of the study drugs. If the AE resolves to baseline or ≤  Grade 1 within 21 
days from  C1D1 , chemotherapy will be administrated on C2D1 as  schedule d. If the 
AE dose not resolve within 21 days from  C1D1 , chemotherapy will be delayed  until 
the AE is resolved . If AE dose not  resolve within 21 days from  planned C2D1, 
chemotherapy  should be  discontinued. For Cohort A, Tislelizumab  should continue as",55,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf

5.5.2. Dose Delay or Modification for Tislelizumab  
There will be no dose reduction for tislelizumab in this study.  
Tislelizumab treatment may be temporarily suspended if the patient experiences a toxicity that is 
considered related to tislelizumab and requires a dose to be withheld.  Tislelizumab treatment 
should resume as soon as possible after the AEs recover to baseline or Grade 1 (whichever is 
more severe) . 
If a patient is benefiting from the study treatment while meeting the discontinuation criteria, the 
patient may continue to receive tislelizumab after discussion and agreement with the medical 
monitor.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 60 6. PRIOR AND CONCOMITANT THERAPY 
6.1. Prior Therap y 
The exclusion criteria ( Section 4.2 ) specify that patients must not have received prior therapy for 
current esophageal cancer, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and prior treatment with 
anti-PD-1, anti -PD-L1, anti -PD-L2 or anti -CTLA -4 (Section 4.2), or any other antibody or drug 
specifically targeting T -cell co -stimulation or checkpoint pathways. All prior and concomitant 
medications (eg, prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, herbal or hom eopathic remedies, 
and nutritional supplements) given to patients within 30 days before the first dose and 30 days 
after the last dose of study treatment (as of safety follow -up visit) should be recorded on the 
CRF.  
6.2. Concomitant Therapy  
6.2.1. Permitted Concomita nt Medications/Procedures  
Most concomitant medications and therapies deemed necessary and in keeping with local 
standards of medical care at the discretion of the investigator for supportive care (eg, antiemetics, 
antidiarrheals) and in a patient’s interes t are allowed.  Opiates and other medication required for 
palliative management of patients are allowed.  Patients must notify the investigator of all 
concurrent medications used during the study. 
Nutritional support for patients with a history of weight l oss is strongly recommended as a routine 
standard-of -care therapy, and such support should be recorded as a concomitant medication.  
6.2.1.1. Systemic Corticosteroids  
Systemic corticosteroids given for the control of imAE s must be tapered gradually (see 
Appendix 7) and be at non -immunosuppressive doses (≤  10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) 
before the next tislelizuma b administration.  The short -term use of steroids as prophylactic 
treatments (eg, patients with contrast allergies to diagnostic imaging contrast dyes) is permitted.",59,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf

Premedication with steroids for chemotherapy is acceptable.  
6.2.1.2. Hepatitis B Treatment  
Patients  with active hepatitis B, defined as HBV DNA ≥ 500 IU/mL at s creening, must initiate 
treatment 2  weeks before first dos e, and continue until 6 months after the last dose of study 
drug(s).  Patients should continue effective antiviral treatment during the s tudy to decrease 
potential viral re -activation risk.  Tenofovir and entecavir are recommended in the American 
Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) guideline because they lack resistance with 
long- term use  (Terrault et al  2017; AASLD/IDSA HCV Guidance Panel, 2015 ).  The 
investigator may use other antiviral agents, if appropriate, following local guidelines.  However, 
interferon -based therapy for hepatitis B is not permitted on study.  
Management of prophylactic antiviral therapy for patients with inactive, treated, and stable 
hepatitis B (HBV DNA <  500 IU/mL) is at the discretion of the investigator, as aligned with 
local guidance.  Such medications must be documented in the patient’s c hart and recorded in the

• Any concurrent anti -cancer therapy, including chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, 
immunotherapy, standard anticancer agents, or investigational anticancer agents  
• Herbal remedies for the treatment of cancer or Chinese patent medicines with 
approval from the Chi na NMPA for use as anticancer treatment (regardless of cancer 
type)  
• Herbal remedies with immune -stimulating properties (eg, mistletoe extract) or that 
are known to potentially interfere with liver or other major organ functions (eg, 
hypericin)

The following medications are restricted during the study:  
• Immunosuppressive agents (except to treat a drug- related AE)  
• Systemic corticosteroids >  10 mg daily (prednisone or equivalent), except to treat or 
control a drug- related AE (per protocol) or for short -term use as prophylactic 
treatment  
• Patients should not abuse alcohol or other drugs during the study. 
• Use of potentially hepatotoxic drugs in patients with impaired hepatic function should 
be carefully monitored.

or transporters because it is expected to be degraded into amino acids and recy cle into other 
proteins. 
 Cisplatin  
During cisplatin use, concurrent therapy with drugs having a potential ototoxic or nephrotoxic effect 
(eg, aminoglycosides, cefalotin, furosemide, and amphotericin B) should be avoided or adequately 
monitored because this  may lead to increased or exacerbated toxicity due to platin- induced changes

The metabolism of paclitaxel is catalyzed by cytochrome P -450 (CYP)2C8 and CYP3A4. 
Caution should be exercised when administering paclitaxel concomitantly with medicines known 
to inhibit or induce either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole and other imidazole 
antifungals, erythromycin, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, clopidogrel, cimetidine, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
indinavir, and nelfinavir ) because the toxicity of paclitaxel may be increased due to higher 
paclitaxel exposure. Administering paclitaxel concomitantly with medicines known to induce 
either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 (eg, rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, efavirenz, nevirapine) is 
not recommended because efficacy may be compromised because of lower paclitaxel exposures.  
 5-Fluorouracil  
Elevated coagulation times have been reported in patients taking fluorouracil concomitantly with 
warfarin. While pharmacokinetic data are not available to assess the effect of fluorouracil 
administration on warfarin pharmacokinetics, the elevation of coagulation times that occurs with 
the fluorouracil prodrug capecitabine is accompanied by an increase in warfarin concentrations. 
Thus, the intera ction may be due to inhibition of cytochrome P450 2C9 by fluorouracil or its 
metabolites.  The investigator should refer to the most current 5- fluorouracil SmPC for all 
potential interactions with 5 -fluorouracil.",61,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf

A table of scheduled study assessments is provided in Appendix 1.  Patients will be closely 
monitored for safety and tolerability throughout the study.  All asse ssments must be performed 
and documented in the medical record for each patient. 
Dosing will occur only if the clinical assessment and local laboratory test values (that must be 
available before any dosing) have been reviewed and found to be acceptable per protocol 
guidelines.  
7.1. Screening  
Screening evaluations will be performed within 28 days prior to first dose of study drug.  
Patients who agree to participate will sign the ICF prior to undergoing any screening procedure.  
The Screening period begins on the first day a screening procedure is conducted.  Screening 
evaluations may be repe ated as needed within the screening period; the investigator is to assess 
patient eligibility according to the latest screening assessment results.  
Results of standard- of-care tests or examinations performed prior to obtaining informed consent 
and ≤  28 day s prior t he first dose may be used for the purposes of screening rather than repeating 
the standard -of-care tests unless otherwise indicated.  
Procedures conducted during the Screening Visit only are described in this section. For the 
description of other a ssessments that are conducted during screening, as well as throughout the 
study, refer to Safety Assessments (Section 7.4), Tumor and Response Evalua tions (Section  7.5)

7.4.4.1. Cardiac enzyme monitoring  
Although immune -mediated  myocarditis is a rare complication of immune checkpoint inhibitors, 
serum creatinine kinase (CK) and CK cardiac isoenzyme (CK -MB) is monitored in all 
tislelizumab studies to protect study participants and to quantify the risk of muscle inflammation 
(see Appendix 1 for the blood collection schedule and Appendix 7 for guidelines for 
management of suspected immune -mediated  myocarditis).  Serum troponins may be substituted 
per local guidelines if used consistently throughout the study. 
7.4.5. Electrocardiograms  
For safety monitoring purposes, the investigator must review, sign, and date all ECG tracings.  
Paper or electronic copies of ECG tracings will be kept as part of the patient's permanent study

The investigator is responsible for the monitoring and documentation of events that meet the 
criteria and definition of an AE or SAE as provided in this protocol. 
8.1. Risks Associated with  Study Drug  
8.1.1. Risks Associated with  Tislelizumab  
Tislelizumab is an investigational agent that is currently in clinical development.  The following 
recommendation is based on results from nonclinical and clinical studies with tislelizumab and 
published data on other molecules within the same biologic class.  
The PD -L1/PD -1 pathway is involved in peripheral immune tolerance; therefore, such therapy 
may increase the risk of imAE s, specifically the induction or enhancement of autoimmune 
conditions.  AEs observed with anti -PD-1 therapy are presented in Section  8.7.3. 
Although most imAE s observed with immunomodulatory agents have been mild and self -
limiting, such events should be recognized early and treated promptly to avoid potential major 
complications.  Suggested evaluation and management guidelines for suspected imAE s are 
provided in Appendix 7.  
8.1.2. Risks Associated with Chemotherapy  
Cisplatin  
Cisplatin produces cumulative nephrotoxicity which is pot entiated by aminoglycoside 
antibiotics. The serum creatinine, BUN, creatinine clearance, and magnesium, sodium, 
potassium, and calcium levels should be measured prior to initiating therapy, and prior to each 
subsequent course. At the recommended dosage, ci splatin should not be given more frequently 
than once every 3 to 4 weeks. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to nephrotoxicity. A 
urine output of 100 mL/hour or greater will tend to minimize cisplatin nephrotoxicity. This can 
be accomplished by incre ased hydration, before and after treatment.

There are reports of severe neuropathies in patients in whom regimens are employed using 
higher doses of cisplatin or greater dose frequencies than those recommended. These 
neuropathies may be irreversible and ar e seen as paresthesias in a stocking -glove distribution, 
areflexia, and loss of proprioception and vibratory sensation. Elderly patients may be more 
susceptible to peripheral neuropathy.  
Loss of motor function has also been reported.  
Anaphylactic -like re actions to cisplatin have been reported. These reactions have occurred within 
minutes of administration to patients with prior exposure to cisplatin, and have been alleviated 
by administration of epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines.  
Ototoxici ty has been observed in patients treated with a single dose of cisplatin. Hearing loss can 
be unilateral or bilateral and tends to become more frequent and severe with repeated doses; 
however, deafness after initial dose of cisplatin has been reported rarely. It is unclear whether 
cisplatin induced ototoxicity is reversible. Careful monitoring by audiometry should be 
performed prior to initiation of therapy and prior to subsequent doses of cisplatin.",67,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf

in bacteria and produces chromosome aberrations in animal cells in tissue culture. In mice , 
cisplatin is teratogenic and embryotoxic. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient 
becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to 
the fetus. Patients should be advised to avoid becoming pr egnant.  
The development of acute leukemia coincident with the use of cisplatin has been reported. In 
these reports, cisplatin was generally given in combination with other leukemogenic agents.  
Injection site reactions may occur during the administration of cisplatin. Given the possibility of 
extravasation, it is recommended to closely monitor the infusion site for possible infiltration 
during drug administration. A specific treatment for extravasation reactions is unknown at this 
time.  
Paclitaxel  
Anaphyla xis and severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by dyspnea and hypotension 
requiring treatment, angioedema, and generalized urticaria have occurred in 2 % to 4% of patients 
receiving paclitaxel in clinical trials. Fatal reactions have occurred in patients despite 
premedication. All patients should be pretreated with corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, and H2 
antagonists. Patients who experience severe hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel should not be 
rechallenged with the drug.  
Bone marrow suppre ssion (primarily neutropenia) is dose -dependent and is the dose -limiting 
toxicity. Neutrophil nadirs occurred at a median of 11 days. Paclitaxel should not be 
administered to patients with baseline neutrophil counts of less than 1.5 x 109/L and platelets 
recover to a level  of > 100 x 109/L.

Severe conduction abnormalities have been documented in < 1% of patients during paclitaxel 
therapy and in some cases requiring pacemaker placement. If patients develop significant 
conduction abnormalities during paclita xel infusion, appropriate therapy should be administered, 
and continuous cardiac monitoring should be performed during subsequent therapy with 
paclitaxel.  
5-Fluorouracil  
It is recommended that patients be hospitalized during their first course of treatment. 
Fluorouracil should be used with extreme caution in poor risk patients with a history of high-
dose pelvic irradiation or previous use of alkylating agents, those who ha ve a widespread 
involvement of bone marrow by metastatic tumors or those with impaired hepatic or renal 
function.  
Rarely, unexpected, severe toxicity (eg, stomatitis, diarrhea, neutropenia and neurotoxicity) 
associated with 5 -FU has been attributed to def iciency of dipyrimidine dehydrogenase activity. A 
few patients have been rechallenged with 5 -FU and despite lowering the 5- FU dose, toxicity 
recurred and progressed with worse morbidity. Absence of this catabolic enzyme appears to 
result in prolonged clear ance of 5 -FU.  
Investigator must advise patients to take measures to minimize exposure to UV light for the

been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals.  
There are no adequate and well -controlled studies with fluorouracil in pregnant women. While 
there is no evidence of teratogenicity in humans due to fluorouracil, it should be kept in mind 
that other drugs which inhibit DNA synthesis (eg, methotrexate and aminopterin) have been 
reported to be teratogenic in humans. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to 
avoid becoming pregnant. If the drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes 
pregnant while taking the drug, the patient should be told of the potential hazard to the fetus. 
Fluorouracil should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential 
risk to the fetus.  
Any form of therapy which adds to the st ress of the patient, interferes with nutrition, or depresses 
bone marrow function will increase the toxicity of fluorouracil.  
8.1.3. Risks Associated with R adiotherapy  
The most notable AEs for radiotherapy included dermatitis, mucositis, hypothyroidism, 
pneumoni a, esophageal obstruction, fistula, or esophagitis.  The majority of AEs were mild to 
moderate in severity and manageable.  Although not life -threatening, these AEs can severely

nonclinical toxicology studies and clinical data with tislelizumab, as well as the 
nonclinical/clinical data from other PD -L1/PD -1 inhibitors, were considered.  Specifically, 
patients  at risk for study- emergent active autoimmune diseases or with a history of autoimmune 
diseases that may relapse, patients who have undergone allogene ic stem cell or organ 
transplantation, and patients who have received a live vaccine ≤  28 days before first dose of 
study drug are excluded from the study.  Patients with contraindications for chemotherapy, 
chemoradiotherapy, or surgery are also excluded from the study (see Section  4.2 for the full list 
of exclusion criteria).  
8.2.2. Safety Monitoring Plan  
Safety will be evaluated in this study through the monitoring of all AEs, defined and graded 
according to NCI -CTCAE v5.0.  All enrolled pati ents will be evaluated clinically and with 
standard laboratory tests at regular intervals during their participation in this study.  Safety 
evaluations will consist of medical interviews, recording of AEs (see Table  9), physical 
examinations, laboratory measurements (hematology, chemistry, etc) and other assessments 
including those listed in Appendix 1.  In addition, patients will be closely monitored for the 
development of any signs or symptoms of infections or autoimmune conditions.",69,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 71 At the start of each cycle, study drug(s) will only be administered aft er clinical laboratory results 
have been reviewed.  Administration of study drug(s) will be performed in a setting where 
emergency medical equipment and staff who are trained to respond to medical emergencies are 
available (see Section  （8.3) ). 
All AEs will be recorded during the study (AE from the time of the first dose and SAEs from the 
time of signing the  informed consent) and for up to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment 
(including chemotherapy  and chemoradiotherapy ) or until the i nitiation of another anticancer 
therapy, whichever occurs first.  At the EOT/Safety Follow -up Visit, ongoing AEs will be 
followed until the event has resolved to baseline or ≤ Grade 1, the event is assessed by the 
investigator as stable, the patient is los t to follow -up, the patient withdraws consent, or it has 
been determined that study treatment or participation is not the cause of the AE. 
Immune -mediated  AEs will be recorded up to 90 days after the last dose of tislelizumab, 
regardless of whether the pat ient starts a new anticancer therapy.  All drug -related SAEs will be 
recorded by the investigator after treatment discontinuation until death, withdrawal of consent, or 
loss to follow up, whichever occurs first.  
Investigators are instructed to report all A Es (including pregnancy -related AEs).  
The potential safety issues anticipated in this study, as well as measures intended to avoid or 
minimize such toxicities, are outlined in Section  8.7. 
8.3. Adverse Events  
8.3.1. Definitions and Reporting  
An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study 
drug, whether considered related to study drug or not. 
Examples of AEs include:",70,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf
131,"finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study 
drug, whether considered related to study drug or not. 
Examples of AEs include:  
• Worsening of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition, including an increase in 
severity, frequency, duration, and/or has an association with a significantly worse 
outcome  
• Detection or diagnosis of a new condition after study drug administration, even 
though the condition may have been present before the start of the study 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study drug 
or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE or SAE)  
When an AE or SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory results, and diagnostics reports) relative to 
the AE or SAE.  The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an AE or 
SAE in the eCRF.  However, there may be instances when copies  of medical records for certain 
cases are requested by the sponsor.  In this instance, all patient identifiers will be blinded on the 
copies of the medical records prior to submission to the sponsor.",70,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf

Original Protocol Version 0.0 30 Jan  2021 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 72 8.3.2. Assessment of Severity  
The investigator will assess the severity of each AE and SAE reported during the study.  AEs and 
SAEs should be assessed and graded based upon the NCI -CTCAE v5.0.  
Toxicities that are not specified in the NCI -CTCAE will be defined as follows:  
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; c linical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated  
• Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)  
• Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but  not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting 
self-care ADL  
• Grade 4: Life- threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
• Grade 5: Death related to AE  
Note: The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous.  Severity is a measure of intensity 
(eg, grade of a specific AE, mild [Grade 1], moderate [Grade 2], severe [Grade 3], or life-
threatening [Grade 4]), whereas seriousness is classified by the criteria based on the regulator y 
definitions.  Seriousness serves as the guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations from 
the sponsor to applicable regulatory authorities as described in Section  8.6.2. 
8.3.3. Assessment of Causality  
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between the study drug and the occurrence 
of each AE or SAE, using best clinical judgment.  Alternative causes , such as natural history of 
the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of 
the AE or SAE to the study drug should be considered and investigated.  The investigator should 
consult the tislelizumab Investigator’s Brochure in the determination of his/her assessment.",71,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf
133,"the AE or SAE to the study drug should be considered and investigated.  The investigator should 
consult the tislelizumab Investigator’s Brochure in the determination of his/her assessment.  
There may be situations when an SAE has occurred, and the investigator has only limited 
information to include in the initial report to the sponsor.  However, it is very important that the 
investigator always assesses causality for every SAE prior to transmission of the SAE report to 
the sponsor, because the causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining 
regulatory reporting requirements.  The investigator may subsequently change his/her opinion of 
causality considering follow -up information and may amend the SAE report accordingly. 
The causality of each AE should be assessed and classified by the investigator as “related” or 
“not related” based on all infor mation available at the time of reporting.  An AE is considered 
related if there is “a reasonable possibility” that the AE may have been caused by the study drug 
(ie, there are facts, evidence, or arguments to suggest possible causation).  A number of fact ors 
should be considered in making this assessment, including:  
• Temporal relationship of the AE to the administration of study treatment/study 
procedure  
• Whether an alternative etiology has been identified  
• Mechanism of action of the study drug",71,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf

Original Protocol Version 0.0 30 Jan  2021 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 73 • Biological pla usibility  
• An AE should be considered “related” to study drug if any of the following criteria 
are met, otherwise the event should be assessed as “not related”:  
− There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factor s can be ruled out . 
− There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely . 
− There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (eg, the AE occurred 
within a reasonable time after administration of the study drug).  However, the 
influence of other factors may have contributed to the AE (eg, the patient’s 
clinical condition or other concomitant AEs).  
8.3.4. Follow -up of Adverse Events  
After the initial AE or SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each patient 
and provide further information to the sponsor on the patient’s condition. 
All AEs and SAEs documented at a previous visit/contact and designated as ongoing will be 
reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts.  
All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution, the condition stabilizes or is considered 
chronic, the AE or SAE is otherwise explained, the patient is lost to follow -up or the patient 
withdraws consent.  The investigator will ensure that follow -up includes any supplemental 
investigations as may be indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE.  
This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, 
radiographic imaging, or consultation with other health care professionals.  
The sponsor may request that the investigator perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible the nature and/or causality of 
the AE or SAE.  The investigator is obligated to assist.  If a  patient dies during participation in",72,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf
135,"measurements and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible the nature and/or causality of 
the AE or SAE.  The investigator is obligated to assist.  If a  patient dies during participation in 
the study or during a recognized follow -up period, the sponsor will be provided with a copy of 
any postmortem findings, including histopathology. 
New or updated information should be reported to the sponsor according t o the SAE instructions 
provided by the sponsor within the time frames outlined in Section  8.6.2.  
8.3.5. Laboratory Test Abnormalities  
Abnormal laboratory findings (eg, clinical chemistry, complete blood count [CBC], coagulation, 
or urinalysis) or other abnormal assessments (eg, ECGs, X -rays, or vital signs) that are judged by 
the investigator as clinically significant will be recorded as AEs or SAEs.  This includes 
clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are present 
at baseline and significantly worsen during the study.  The definition of clinically significant is 
left to the judgment of the investigator.  In general, these are the laboratory test abnormalities or 
other ab normal assessments that:  
• are associated with clinical signs or symptoms, or  
• require active medical intervention, or",72,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 74 • lead to dose interruption or discontinuation, or  
• require close observation, more frequent follow -up assessments, or further diagnostic 
inves tigation.  
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (eg, alkaline 
phosphatase and bilirubin 5 x ULN associated with cholestasis), only the diagnosis (ie, 
cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard 
definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the AE.  For example, an elevated serum 
potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia.”  
8.4. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an AE in 
which the patient was at risk of death a t the time of the AE.  It does not refer to an AE 
that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
• Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
Note: In general, hospitalization signifies that the patient was admitted (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) to the hospital or emergency ward for 
observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s 
office or outpatient setting.  
• Results in disability/incapacity  
Note: The term “di sability” means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relatively minor medical significance, such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, i nfluenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle), which may 
interfere with or prevent everyday life functions, but do not constitute a substantial 
disruption.",73,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf

• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is considered a significant medical AE by the investigat or based on medical 
judgement (eg, may jeopardize the patient or may require medical/surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above)  
The following are NOT  considered to be SAEs:  
• Hospitalization for elective treatment of a preexisting con dition that did not worsen 
from baseline  
• Hospitalization for social/convenience considerations  
• Scheduled therapy for the target disease of the study, including admissions for 
transfusion support or convenience",73,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf

A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) is a serious adverse reaction that is 
both unexpected (ie, not present in the product’s Reference Safety Information [RSI]) and meets 
the definition of a serious adverse drug reaction (SADR), the spec ificity or severity of which is 
not consistent with those noted in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
8.6. Timing, Frequency, and Method of Capturing Adverse Events and 
Serious Adverse Events  
8.6.1. Adverse Event Recording Period  
After informed consent has been signed but prior to the administration of the study drug, only 
SAEs should be reported.  
After initiation of study drug, all AEs and SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be 
reported until either 30 days after last dose of study drug(s) or initiation of new anticancer 
therapy, whichever occurs first.  Immune -mediated  AEs (serious or non- serious)  should be 
reported until  90 days after the last dose of tislelizumab, regardless of whether or not the patient 
starts a new anticancer therapy .  All SAEs consider ed related to the study drug(s) that are 
brought to the attention of the investigator should be reported regardless of time since the last 
dose of treatment.  
AEs and SAEs should be recorded according to the details in Table 9.  For the follow -up period

Section  8.6.2.1.  The sponsor has a legal respons ibility to notify, as appropriate, both the local 
regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a product under clinical 
investigation.

When a study center receives an initial or follow -up safety report or other safety inf ormation (eg, 
revised Investigator’s Brochure) from the sponsor, the investigator or designated responsible 
person is required to promptly notify his/her IRB or IEC.  The investigator should place copies 
of Safety Reports from the sponsor in the Investigat or Site File.  
8.6.3. Eliciting Adverse Events  
The investigator or designee will ask patients about AEs by asking the following standard 
questions:  
• How are you feeling?  
• Have you had any medical problems since your last visit?  
• Have you taken any new medicines since your last visit?  
8.6.4. Disease Progression  
Disease progression, which is expected in this study population and measured as an efficacy 
endpoint, should not be recorded as an AE term.  Similarly, nonserious AEs that are clearly 
consistent with the  pattern of progression of the underlying disease and are considered 
unequivocally due to disease progression should not be recorded.  However, if there is any 
uncertainty as to whether a nonserious AE is due to disease progression, it should be recorded a s 
an AE.  All SAEs and deaths regardless of relatedness to disease progression should be recorded 
and reported (see  Section  8.6.2).  
8.6.5. Deaths  
Death is an  outcome and not usually considered an event.  If the only information available is 
death and the cause of death is unknown, then the death is reported as an AE, eg, “death,” “death 
of unknown cause,” or “death unexplained.”

expeditiously submitted to the sponsor to facilitate outcome follow -up.  Information on the status 
of the mother and child will be forwarded to the sponsor.  Generally, follow -up will be no longer 
than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date.  Any premature termination of the 
pregnancy will be reported. 
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE, any pregnancy complication or elective 
termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or SAE.

Boards, and Independent Ethics Committees  
The sponsor will promptly assess all SAEs against cumulative study drug experience to identify 
and expeditiously communicate new safety findings to regulatory authori ties, investigators, 
IRBs, and IECs based on applicable legislation.  
To determine the reporting requirements for individual SAEs, the sponsor will assess the 
expectedness of the SAEs using the following reference safety information (RSI) documents:  
• Tislelizumab Investigator’s Brochure  
• Cisplatin prescribing information  
• Paclitaxel  prescribing information  
• 5-FU prescribing information  
8.6.8. Assessing and Recording Immune -mediated  Adverse Events  
Since treatment with anti -PD-1 therapy can cause autoimmune disorders, AEs considered by the 
investigator to be immune -mediated  (see Section  8.7.3) should be classified as imAE s and 
identified as such in the eCRF AE page.  N ot all tislelizumab studies include a section on the 
eCRF AE page where imAE s are clearly identified .  Therefore , all studies will rely on the 
company list of Potential imAE s to id entify all cases in each study to be further assessed as 
immune -mediated  AEs by the sponsor, in addition to those imAE s reported by the investigator 
via the AE CRF page.  
Investigators should consult the guidance on diagnostic evaluation and management of i mAE s, 
which are commonly seen with immune checkpoint inhibitors, in Appendix 7. 
An extensive list of potential imAE s appears in Table 12.  All conditions similar to thos e listed 
should be evaluated to determine whether they are imAE s, based on a similar diagnostic process 
to those reactions that are presented in more detail in Appendix 7.

vomiting, mya lgia, dizziness, or hypertension.  Severe reactions may include acute respiratory 
distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, or cardiogenic shock.  These 
infusion- related AEs should be recorded as “infusion- related reaction” instead of the individual 
signs and symptoms.  
8.7. Management of AE of Special Interest  
As a routine precaution, after infusion of tislelizumab on Day 1 of Cycle  2 and Cycle  3, patients 
must be monitored for at least 60 minutes afterward in an area with resuscitation  equipment a nd 
emergency agents.  From Cycle 4 onward, a minimum of a 30- minute monitoring period is 
required in an area with resuscitation equipment and emergency agents.

diphenhydramine or equivalent), antipyretic (eg, paracetamol or equivalent), and if considered 
indicated, oral or intravenous glucocorticoids, epinephrine, bronchodilators, and oxygen.  In the 
next cycle, patients should receive oral premedication with an antihistamine (eg, 
diphenhydramine or equivalent) and an antipyretic (eg, paracetamol or equivalent), and they 
should be closely monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of an infusion reaction.  
NCI-CTCAE Grade  3 or 4 infusion reaction: Proper medical management should be instituted 
immediately, as indicated per type and severity of the re action.  This includes, but is not limited 
to, oral or intravenous antihistamines, antipyretics, glucocorticoids, epinephrine, bronchodilators, 
and oxygen.  
8.7.2. Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions and Flu -Like Symptoms  
If hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the pat ient must be treated according to the best available 
medical practice as described in the complete guideline for emergency treatment of anaphylactic 
reactions according to the Working Group of the Resuscitation Council (UK)  (Soar J et al 
2008)) ).  Patients should be instructed to report any delayed reactions to the investigator 
immediately.  
In the event of a systemic anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction the infusion must be immediately 
stopped, and t he patient discontinued from the study.  Systemic anaphylactic/anaphylactoid 
reactions typically manifest within minutes following administration of the drug/antigen and are 
characterized by respiratory distress; laryngeal edema; and/or intense bronchospas m; and often 
followed by vascular collapse or shock without antecedent respiratory difficulty; cutaneous",79,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf

followed by vascular collapse or shock without antecedent respiratory difficulty; cutaneous 
manifestations such as pruritus and urticaria with/without edema; and gastrointestinal 
manifestations such as nausea, vomiting, crampy abdominal pain, and diarrhea.  
The patient will be administered epinephrine injection and dexamethasone infusion if 
hypersensitivity reaction is observed.  The patient should then be placed on monitor 
immediately, and ICU should be alerted for possible transfer if needed.  
For prophylaxis of flu- like symptoms, a dose of 25  mg indomethacin or a comparable dose of 
nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (ie, 600 mg ibuprofen, 500 mg naproxen sodium) may be 
administered 2  hours before and 8 hours after the start of each dose of st udy drugs(s) infusion.  
Alternative treatments for fever (ie, paracetamol) may be given to patients at the discretion of the 
investigator. 
8.7.3. Immune -Mediated  Adverse Events  
Immune -mediated  AEs are of special interest in this study.  If the events listed below  or similar 
events occur, the investigator should exclude alternative explanations (eg, combination drugs, 
infectious disease, metabolic, toxin, disease progression, or other neoplastic causes) with 
appropriate diagnostic tests that may include, but are not limited to, serologic, immunologic, and 
histologic (biopsy) data.  If alternative causes have been ruled out; the AE required the use of 
systemic steroids, other immunosuppressants, or endocrine therapy; and is consistent with an 
immune -mediated mechanis m of action, the imAE  indicator in the eCRF AE page should be 
checked.",79,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf

last dose of study drugs regardless of whether or not the patient starts a new anticancer therapy.  
9.2. Efficacy Analyses  
9.2.1. Primary Efficacy Analysis  
pCR rate  
pCR rate is the pri mary endpoint of the study. pCR rate is defined as the proportion of patients 
with absence of residual tumor in the resected primary tumor and all resected lymph nodes after 
completion of neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery as  assessed by the investiga tor in the EE 
set. 
The pCR rate in C ohort A (Responder: decrease in PET SUVmax ≥ 35%) and C ohort B (Non-
Responder: decrease in PET SUVmax <35%) will be summarized. Clopper -Pearson 95% 
confidence interval (CI) of pCR in C ohort s A and B will be calculated.  
These analyses will be performed in the EE analysis set as the primary analysis. Outcomes in the 
Per-Protocol analysis set will be evaluated as the  sensitivity analysis.  The analysis of pCR rate 
will occur after all the patients in the EE analysis set have b een assessed for pathological 
response .

1-year/3 -year Disease- Free Survival (DFS) rate defined as the proportion of patients free from 
disease event at 1st year and 3rd year after the first date of no disease. DFS is defined as the time 
from  the first date of no disease to local or distant recurrence or death due to any cause, 
whichever occurs first. If patients were alive without recurrence, DFS was determined from the 
first date of no disease to the date of last known date and will be censored on the date of last 
known date. DFS rate will be estimated in cohort A and B by Kaplan- Meier method with 95%

occurs first: radiographic disease progression as assessed by the investigator according to 
RECIST v1.1, or death due to any cause. Patients who die without a progression/disease 
recurrence will be considered to have experienced an event on the date of their death. Patients 
who did not report progression/recurrence of disease or die will be censored on the date of their 
last evaluable tumor assessment. Patients who started any subsequent anticancer therapy without 
a prior report ed progression/recurrence will be censored at the last evaluable tumor assessment 
before initiation of the subsequent anticancer therapy. EFS rate will be analyzed similarly as the 
DFS rate for patients in the EE analysis set.  
Objective response rate (ORR)  
Objective response rate (ORR) is the proportion of patients who ha ve a complete response or 
partial response before surgery as assessed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1 in the patients 
with measurable disease at baseline in the ITT analysis set. ORR wi ll be summarized in cohort  A 
and B . 
9.2.3. Exploratory Efficacy Analysis  
1-year/3 -year OS rate is defined as the proportion of patients alive at 1st year and 3rd year after 
enrollment. Data for patients who are not reported as having died at the time of analysis will be 
censored at the date last known to be alive. OS rate will be estimated in cohort A and B by 
Kaplan -Meier method for patients in the ITT analysis set.  
Biomarker analysis including Programmed death ligand 1 [PD -L1] expression and gene 
expres sion profile will be examined in the EE analyses set. Any potential association between 
biomarker s and treatment effects (including but not limited to pCR, MPR, DFS , EFS , and ORR )

Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). AEs will be coded to MedDRA by 
lower level term, P referred T erm, and P rimary S ystem O rgan C lass.  
A TEAE is defined as an AE that ha s an onset date or a worsening in severity from baseline 
(pretreatment) on or after the first dose of study drugs and up to 30 days after study drug 
discontinuation or initiation of new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first. For the 
tislelizumab arm, the TEAE classification also applies to imAE s that are recorded up to 90 days 
after discontinuation from tislelizumab, regardless of whether the patient starts a new anticancer 
therapy. Only those AEs that were treatment emergent  will be included in summary tables. All 
AEs, treatment emergent or otherwise, will be presented in patient data listings.  
The incidence of TEAEs will be reported as the number (percentage) of patients with TEAEs by 
system organ class and preferred term. A patient will be counted only once by the highest 
severity grade per NCI -CTCAE v5.0 within a system organ class and preferred term, even if the 
patient experienced more than 1 TEAE within a specific system organ class and preferred term. 
The number (perce ntage) of patients with TEAEs will also be summarized by relationship to the 
study drug(s). Treatment -related AEs include th ose events considered by the investigator to be 
related to study treatment or with missing assessment of the causal relationship. SA Es, deaths,

2011; ( Ilson et al 2012; Greally et al 2018 ) The pCR rate in cohort A is assumed to be 37%. 
Assuming there are 35 evaluable patients in cohort A, i t will provide the probability of 69.0% to 
observe 12 pCR out of 35 evaluable patients with point of estimate of pCR rate = 34.3% greater 
than the historical pCR rate in cohort A.   
The pCR rate of non- responders was reported about 4% -  13.6% in historical  studies 
(Buschenfelde et al 2011 ; Greally et al ; 2018, Ilson et al 2012). The pCR rate in cohort B is 
assumed to be 22%. Assuming there are 23 evaluable patients in cohort B, it will provide a 
probability of 77.8% to observe 4 pCR out of 23 evaluable pati ents with point of estimate of pCR 
rate = 17.4% greater than the historical pCR rate in cohort B.   
Approximately 65 patients are expected to be enrolled in this study considering about 10%

TUMORS (RECIST) GUIDELINES, VERSION 1.1  
Source: ( Eisenhauer e t al 2009)  
Definitions  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this trial using the international criteria proposed 
by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee (v1.1).  Changes in 
only the largest diameter (uni -dimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the 
RECIST criteria.  
Note: Lesions are either measurable or nonmeasurable using the criteria provided below.  The 
term “evaluable” in reference to measurabi lity will not be used because it does not provide 
additional meaning or accuracy.  
Measurable Disease  
Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
• 10 mm by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (no 
less than double the slice thickness and a minimum of 10 mm). Assumes a scan slice 
thickness no greater than 5 mm. 
• 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (when superficial)  
• 20 mm by chest X -ray (if clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung)  
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must be ≥  15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended t o be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will 
be measured and followed. 
Nonmeasurable Disease  
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis), are considered nonmeasurable 
disease.  Leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural, or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast 
disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly",108,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf
202,"disease.  Leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural, or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast 
disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly 
identified  by physical examination that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques are 
all nonmeasurable.  
Bone lesions:  
• Bone scan, positron- emission tomography (PET) scan, or plain films are not 
considered adequate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions.  However, these 
techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions. 
• Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques such as CT 
or MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets 
the definition of measurability described above.",108,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 110 • Blastic bone lesions are nonmeasurable.  
Cystic lesions:  
• Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically def ined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor nonmeasurable) since they 
are, by definition, simple cysts. 
• Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above.  However, if 
non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as 
target lesions.  
Lesions with prior local treatment:  
• Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated are a, or in an area subjected to other 
loco-regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been 
demonstrated progression in the lesion.  Trial protocols should detail the conditions 
under which such lesions would be considered measur able.  
Target Lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2  lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, should be 
identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be 
selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all 
involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor.  Pathological nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of 
≥ 15 mm by CT scan.  Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to  the baseline sum.  
The short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by radiologists to judge if a node is 
involved by solid tumor.  Nodal size is normally reported as 2 dimensions in the plane in which",109,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf
204,"The short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by radiologists to judge if a node is 
involved by solid tumor.  Nodal size is normally reported as 2 dimensions in the plane in which 
the image is obtained (for CT scan, this is a lmost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of 
acquisition may be axial, sagittal, or coronal).  The smaller of these measures is the short axis.  
For example, an abdominal node which is reported as being 20 mm by 30 mm has a short axis of 
20 mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node.  In this example, 20 mm should be 
recorded as the node measurement.  All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥  10 mm 
but < 15 mm) should be considered nontarget lesions.  Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are 
considered nonpathological and should not be recorded or followed.  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non- nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph  nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.  
Nontarget Lesions

nontarget lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required and",109,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 111 these lesions should be followed as “present,”  “absent,” or in rare cases “unequivocal 
progression” (more details to follow).  In addition, it is possible to record multiple nontarget 
lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the case record form (eg, “multiple enlarged 
pelvic lymph nodes” or “multiple liver metastases”).  
Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed.  All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatm ent start and never 
more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.  Imaging- based evaluation 
should always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed 
cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical examination.  
• Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial and ≥ 10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (eg, skin nodules).  For 
the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography including a ruler to 
estimate the size of the lesion is suggested.  As noted above, when lesions can be 
evaluated by both clinica l examination and imaging, imaging evaluation should be 
undertaken since it is more objective and may also be reviewed at the end of the trial.  
• Chest X -ray: Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression is 
an important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in 
identifying new lesions.  However, lesions on chest X -ray may be considered 
measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  
• CT, MRI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure",110,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf
206,"measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  
• CT, MRI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure 
lesions selected for response assessment.  This guideline has defined measurability of 
lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less.  
When CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5  mm, the minimum size for a 
measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in 
certain situations (eg, for body scans).  
• Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be 
used as a method of m easurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in 
their entirety for independent review at a later date, and because they are operator 
dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be 
taken from one assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in 
the course of the study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised.  If there is concern 
about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
• Endoscopy, laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, they can be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials 
where recurrence following complete respons e (CR) or surgical resection is an 
endpoint.",110,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 112 • Tumor markers: Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor 
response.  If markers are initially above the upper normal limit, however, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in CR.  B ecause tumor markers are disease 
specific, instructions for their measurement should be incorporated into protocols on a 
disease specific basis.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent 
ovarian cancer) and prostate -specific antigen respo nse (in recurrent prostate cancer), 
have been published.  In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed 
CA-125 progression criteria which are to be integrated with objective tumor 
assessment for use in first -line trials in ovarian cancer.  
• Cytology, histology: These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
response (PR) and CR in rare cases if required by protocol (for example, residual 
lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors 
can remai n).  When effusions are known to be a potential adverse effect of treatment 
(eg, with certain taxane compounds or angiogenesis inhibitors), the cytological 
confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during 
treatment can b e considered if the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease in order to differentiate between response (or stable disease) and 
progressive disease.  
Response Criteria  
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
• Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or nontarget) must have reduction in short axis to 
< 10 mm.  
• Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline su m diameters  
• Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target",111,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf
208,"lesions, taking as reference the baseline su m diameters  
• Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum 
if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum 
must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5  mm.  (Note: The appearance 
of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).  
• Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to q ualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study 
• Lymph nodes: Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual 
short axis measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the 
baseline examinat ion), even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study.  This 
means that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the “sum” of lesions 
may not be zero even if CR criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as 
having a short axis of <  10 mm.  Case report form may be designed to have target 
nodal lesions recorded in a separate section where, in order to qualify for CR, each 
node must achieve a short axis <10 mm.  For PR, SD and PD, the actual short axis 
measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target lesions.",111,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 113 • Target lesions that become “too small to measure.”  While on study, all lesions (nodal 
and non- nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded 
at each subsequent evaluation, even when very sma ll (eg, 2 mm).  However, 
sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as target lesions at baseline 
become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an 
exact measure and may report them as being “too small to measur e.” 
When this occurs, it is important that a value be recorded on the electronic case report 
form (eCRF).  If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely 
disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm.  If the lesion is believe d 
to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm 
should be assigned. (Note: It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes 
since they usually have a definable size when normal and are frequently surrounde d 
by fat, such as in the retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is believed to be 
present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should 
be assigned in this circumstance as well).  This default value is derived from the 
5 mm CT slice thickness (but should not be changed with varying CT slice thickness).  
The measurement of these lesions is potentially nonreproducible; therefore, providing 
this default value will prevent false responses or progressions based upon 
measurement error.  To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to provide an 
actual measure, that measurement should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.

longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the",112,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf
210,"• Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment : When non- nodal lesions “fragment,” the 
longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the 
target lesion sum.  Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be 
maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each 
individual lesion.  If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer 
separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal 
longest diameter for the “coalesced lesion.”  
Evaluation of Nontarget Lesions  
While some nontarget lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and 
instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points specified in the protocol.  
• CR: Disappearance of all nontarget lesions and normalization of tumor marker level.  
All lymph nodes must be nonpathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).  
• Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more nontarget lesion(s) and/or maintenance 
of tumor marker level above the normal limits  
• PD: Unequivocal progression (as detailed below) of existing nontarget lesions.  
(Note: The ap pearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.)  
• When the patient also has measurable disease: In this setting, to achieve “unequivocal 
progression” on the basis of the nontarget disease, there must be an overall level of 
substantial wo rsening in nontarget disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in 
target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy.  A modest “increase” in the size of one or more nontarget 
lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.  The",112,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 114 designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in nontarget disease 
in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.  
• When the patient has only nonmeasurable disease:  This circumstance arises in some 
phase  3 trials when it is not a criterion of trial entry to have measurable disease.  The 
same general concept applies here as noted above; however, in this instance there is 
no measurable disease assess ment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in 
nonmeasurable disease burden.  Because worsening in nontarget disease cannot be 
easily quantified (by definition: if all lesions are truly nonmeasurable) a useful test 
that can be applied when assess ing patients for unequivocal progression is to consider 
if the increase in overall disease burden based on the change in nonmeasurable 
disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare 
PD for measurable disease: ie, an in crease in tumor burden representing an additional 
73% increase in “volume” (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a 
measurable lesion).  
• Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from “trace” to “large,” an 
increase in lymphangitic dise ase from localized to widespread, or may be described in 
protocols as “sufficient to require a change in therapy.”  If “unequivocal progression” 
is seen, the patient should be considered to have had overall PD at that point.  While 
it would be ideal to have objective criteria to apply to nonmeasurable disease, the 
very nature of that disease makes it impossible to do so; therefore, the increase must 
be substantial.

212,"New Lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, s ome 
comments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for the 
identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be 
unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging 
modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some “new” 
bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of preexisting lesions).  This is particularly 
important when the patient’s baseline lesions show  partial or complete response.  For example, 
necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a “new” cystic lesion, which it 
is not. 
A lesion identified on a follow -up trial in an anatomical location that was not  scanned at baseline 
is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.  An example of this is the 
patient who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain scan 
ordered that reveals metastases.  The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of 
PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline. 
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow -up eva luation will clarify if it represents truly new disease.  If repeat scans confirm there 
is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.  
While fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) -PET response assessments need additional study, it is 
sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning 
in assessment of progression (particularly possible “new” disease).  New lesions on the basis of 
FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the f ollowing algorithm:",113,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf

• No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up: If the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is

on CT, additional follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly 
progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD wi ll be the date of the initial 
abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 116 response may not be docum ented until after the end of therapy so protocols should be clear if 
post-treatment assessments are to be considered in determination of best overall response.  
Protocols must specify how any new therapy introduced before progression will affect best 
respo nse designation.  The patient’s best overall response assignment will depend on the findings 
of both target and nontarget disease and will also take into consideration the appearance of new 
lesions.  Furthermore, depending on the nature of the trial and the protocol requirements, it may 
also require confirmatory measurement.  Specifically, in nonrandomized trials where response is 
the primary endpoint, confirmation of PR or CR is needed to deem either one the “best overall 
response.”  
The best overall response is determined once all the data for the patient is known. 
Best response determination in trials where confirmation of complete or partial response IS NOT 
required : Best response in these trials is defined as the best response across all time points (for  
example, a patient who has SD at first assessment, PR at second assessment, and PD on last 
assessment has a best overall response of PR).  When SD is believed to be best response, it must 
also meet the protocol specified minimum time from baseline.  If th e minimum time is not met 
when SD is otherwise the best time point response, the patient’s best response depends on the 
subsequent assessments.  For example, a patient who has SD at first assessment, PD at second 
and does not meet minimum duration for SD, will have a best response of PD.  The same patient 
lost to follow -up after the first SD assessment would be considered inevaluable.

Best response determination in trials where confirmation of complete or partial response IS 
required : Complete or partial re sponses may be claimed only if the criteria for each are met at a 
subsequent time point as specified in the protocol (generally 4 weeks later).  
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to “normal” 
size (< 10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans.  This measurement should 
be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to overstate progression should it be 
based on increase in size of the nodes.  As noted earlier, this means that patients  with CR may 
not have a total sum of “zero.”  
In trials where confirmation of response is required, repeated ""NE"" (not evaluable) time point 
assessments may complicate best response determination.  The analysis plan for the trial must 
address how missing data/assessments will be addressed in determination of response and 
progression.  For example, in most trials it is reasonable to consider a patient with time point 
responses of PR -NE-PR as a confirmed response.  
Patients with a global deterioration  of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration”.  Every effort should be made to document objective progression 
even after discontinua tion of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an 
objective response: it is a reason for stopping trial therapy.  
Conditions that define “early progression, early death, and inevaluability” are trial specific and 
should be clearly desc ribed in each protocol (depending on treatment duration, treatment 
periodicity).

may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases where a 
residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represe nt fibrosis or scarring.  The use of 
FDG -PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol and supported 
by disease specific medical literature for the indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that 
both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy 
resolution/ sensitivity.  
For equivocal findings of progression (eg, very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic changes, 
or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled assessment.  If 
progression is confirmed at the next scheduled assessment, the date of progression should be the 
earlier date when progression was suspected.  
Confirmation of Measurement/Duration of Response

In the case of SD, measuremen ts must have met the SD criteria at least once after trial entry at a

The recommendations below for the diagnosis and management of any immune -mediated  AE 
(imAE ) are intended as a guidance.  This document should be used in conjunction with expert 
clinical judgement (by specialist physicians experienced in the treatment of canc er using 
immunological agents), and individual institutional guidelines or policies. 
Criteria used to diagnose imAE s include blood tests, diagnostic imaging, histopathology, and 
microbiology assessments to exclude alternative causes such as infection, dise ase progression, 
and adverse effects of concomitant drugs.  In addition to the results of these tests, the following 
factors should be considered when making an imAE  diagnosis:  
• What was the temporal relationship between initiation of tislelizumab and the A E? 
• How did the patient respond to withdrawal of tislelizumab?  
• Did the event recur when tislelizumab was reintroduced?  
• Was there a clinical response to corticosteroids?  
• Is the event an autoimmune endocrinopathy?  
• Is disease progression or an alternative diagnosis a more likely explanation?  
When alternative explanations to autoimmune toxicity have been excluded, the imAE  field 
associated with the AE in the eCRF should be checked. If further diagnostic evaluations change 
the assessment, the eCRF  should be updated accordingly.

Consider consultation with an endocrinologist if an abnormality is detected.  
Pneumonitis  All patients presenting with new or worsened pulmonary symptoms or signs, such 
as an upper respiratory infection, new cough, shortness of bre ath, or hypoxia 
should be assessed by high- resolution CT.  Consider pulmonary function test 
including D LCO. 
Radiographic appearance is often nonspecific.  Depending on the location of the 
abnormality, bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage or lung biopsy may be 
considered.  Consult with a respiratory medicine physician for cases of uncertain 
cause.",119,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf

Immune -mediated  
Toxicity  Diagnostic Evaluation Guideline  
Neurological Toxicity  Perform a comprehensive neurological examination and brain MRI for all CNS 
symptoms; review alcohol history and other medications.  Conduct a diabetic 
screen and assess blood B12/folate, HIV status, TFTs, and consider autoimmune 
serology.  Consider the nee d for brain/spine MRI/MRA and nerve conduction 
study for peripheral neuropathy.  Consult with a neurologist if there are abnormal 
findings.  
Colitis  Review dietary intake and exclude steatorrhea.  Consider comprehensive testing, 
including the following: FB C, UEC, LFTs, CRP, TFTs, stool microscopy and 
culture, viral PCR, Clostridium difficile  toxin, and cryptosporidia (drug -resistant 
organism).  
In case of abdominal discomfort, consider imaging, eg, X -ray, CT scan.  If a 
patient experiences bleeding, pain, or  distension, consider colonoscopy with 
biopsy and surgical intervention as appropriate.  
Eye Disorders  If a patient experiences acute, new onset, or worsening of eye inflammation; 
blurred vision; or other visual disturbances, refer the patient urgently to an 
ophthalmologist for evaluation and management.  
Hepatitis  Check ALT/AST/total bilirubin, INR/albumin; the frequency will depend on 
severity of the AE (eg, daily if Grade  3 to 4; every 2  to 3 days if Grade 2, until 
recovering).  Review medications (eg, s tatins, antibiotics) and alcohol history.  
Perform liver screen including Hepatitis A/B/C serology, Hepatitis E PCR and 
assess anti -ANA/SMA/LKM/SLA/LP/LCI, iron studies.  Consider imaging (eg, 
ultrasound scan for metastases or thromboembolism).  Consult wi th a hepatologist 
and consider liver biopsy.  
Renal toxicity  Review hydration status and medication history.  Test and culture urine.  Consider",120,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf

Renal toxicity  Review hydration status and medication history.  Test and culture urine.  Consider 
renal ultrasound scan, protein assessment (dipstick/24- hour urine collection), or 
phase -contrast microscopy.  Refer to a nephrologist for further management 
assistance.  
Dermatology  Consider other causes by conducting a physical examination.  Consider 
dermatology referral for skin biopsy.  
Joint or muscle 
inflammation  Conduct musculoskeletal history a nd perform complete musculoskeletal 
examination.  Consider joint X -ray and other imaging as required to exclude 
metastatic disease.  Perform autoimmune serology and refer to rheumatology for 
further management assistance.  
For suspected myositis/rhabdomyolysis/myasthenia include: CK, ESR, CRP, 
troponin, and consider a muscle biopsy.  
Myocarditis  Perform ECG, echocardiogram, CK/CK -MB, troponin (I and/or T), and refer to a 
cardiologist.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 122 Treatment of Immune -mediated  Adverse Events  
• Immune -mediated  AEs can escalate quickly.  Study treatment interruption, close 
monitoring, timely diagnostic work- up, and treatment intervention as appropriate is 
required.  
• Immune -mediate d AEs should improve promptly after introduction of 
immunosuppressive therapy.  If this does not occur, review the diagnosis, seek further 
specialist advice, and contact the study medical monitor. 
• For some Grade 3 toxicities that resolve quickly, rechallenge with study drug may be 
considered if there is evidence of a clinical response to study treatment, after 
consultation with the study medical monitor. 
• Steroid dosages in the table below are for oral or intravenous (methyl)prednisolone.  
Equivalent dosages  of other corticosteroids can be substituted.  For steroid -refractory 
imAE s, consider use of steroid- sparing agents (eg, mycophenolate mofetil [MMF]).  
• Consider prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections if the patient is 
receiving long- term immu nosuppressive therapy.  
• Tislelizumab must be permanently discontinued for any onset of Grade 4 or recurrent 
Grade 3 immune -mediated  AEs.

COLLABORATION (CKD -EPI) EQUATION  
In adults, the most widely- used equations for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from 
serum creatinine are the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiolo gy Collaboration (CKD -EPI) 
equation ((Levey et al  2009 ),  and the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study 
equation.  The Nationa l Kidney Disease Education Program (NKDEP) calculators rely on 
creatinine determinations which are isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) traceable.  All 
laboratories should be using creatinine methods calibrated to be IDMS traceable.  
This CKD- EPI equat ion calculator should be used when serum creatinine (S cr) is reported in 
mg/dL.  This equation is recommended when eGFR values above 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 are 
desired.  
GFR = 141 × min (S cr /κ, 1)α × max(S cr /κ, 1)-1.209 × 0.993Age × 1.018 [if female] × 1.159 [ if 
black]  
where:  
Scr is serum creatinine in mg/dL,  
κ is 0.7 for females and 0.9 for males,  
α is -0.329 for females and - 0.411 for males,  
min indicates the minimum of S cr /κ or 1, and 
max indicates the maximum of S cr /κ or 1. 
The equation does not require weight because the results are reported normalized to 1.73 m2 
body surface area, which is an accepted average adult surface area.  
The online calculator for CKD -EPI can be found here:

OF “WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING POTENTIAL,” “NO 
CHILDBEARING POTENTIAL”  
Contraception Guidelines  
The Clinical Trials Facilitation Group recommendations related to contraception and pregnancy 
testing in clinical trials include the use of highly effective forms of birth control((Clinical Trials 
Facilitation Group 2014)) .  These methods include the following:  
• Combined (estrogen-  and progestogen- containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with the inhibition of ovulation 
− Oral, intravaginal, or transdermal  
• Progestogen- only hormonal contraception as sociated with the inhibition of ovulation 
− Oral, injectable, implantable  
Note: Oral birth control pills are not considered a highly effective form of birth 
control, and if they are selected, they must be used with a second, barrier method 
of contraception s uch as condoms with or without spermicide.  
• An intrauterine device  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Vasectomized partner  
Note: This is only considered a highly effective form of birth control when the 
vasectomized partner is t he sole partner of the study participant and there has been a 
medical assessment confirming surgical success.  
− A sterile male is one for whom azoospermia, in a semen sample, has been 
demonstrated as definitive evidence of infertility.  
• Sexual abstinence (def ined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the 
entire period of risk associated with the study treatment)  
Note: Total sexual abstinence should only be used as a contraceptive method if it is in 
line with the patients’ usual and preferred lifes tyle.  Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, 
ovulation, sympto- thermal, post -ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the 
duration of exposure to study drug, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of",133,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf
245,"ovulation, sympto- thermal, post -ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the 
duration of exposure to study drug, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
contraception. 
Of note, barrier contraception ( including male and female condoms with or without spermicide) 
is not considered a highly effective method of contraception, and if used, this method must be 
used in combination with one of the highly effective forms of birth control listed above. 
Definitio ns of “Women of Childbearing Potential,” “Women of No Childbearing Potential”  
As defined in this protocol, “women of childbearing potential” are female patients who are 
physiologically capable of becoming pregnant.",133,data/BGB\BGB A317-213 original protocol EN Final.pdf
246,"BGB -A317- 213 BeiGene  
Original Protocol Version 0.0 30 Jan  2021 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 135 Conversely, “women of no childbearing pot ential” are defined as female patients meeting any of 
the following criteria:  
• Surgically sterile (ie, through bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or 
hysterectomy)  
• Postmenopausal, defined as:  
− ≥ 55 years of age with no spontaneous menses for ≥ 12 months OR  
− < 55 years of age with no spontaneous menses for ≥ 12 months AND with 
postmenopausal follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration > 30 IU/mL  
and all alternative medical causes for the lack of spontaneous menses for ≥ 12 
months have been rul ed out, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome, 
hyperprolactinemia, etc.  
If an FSH measurement is required to confirm postmenopausal state, concomitant use of 
hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy should be excluded.

The study consists of a prescreening and/or screening phase, a treatment phase that includes a neo-
adjuvant  phase, surgery and disease  follow -up phase.  
The study schema is presented in  Figure 1, Section  3.1   
Neo-adjuvant  Phase:  
During the neo-adjuvant  phase, patients who are found to have disease progression at scheduled tumor 
assessments (before Cycle 3 and surgery) or at any time during neo-adjuvant  treatment and are still 
deemed resectable and non -metastatic will proceed to re ceive surgery if amenable and will remain eligible 
for all on -study evaluations based on investigator’s judgement.  
Patients who discontinue neo-adjuvant  treatment early because of urgent surgery  (eg., because of  intestinal 
obstruction, intestinal perforati on, or intestinal bleeding ), disease progression or intolerable AEs  and do 
not proceed to a complete resection  will proceed to receive other treatment as determined by the 
investigator.  Further in -clinic study procedures  of these patients should  be discussed with  the medical 
monitor.  
Surgery:  
Upon completion of neo-adjuvant  therapy, patients will undergo surgical resection of their tumor. Surgical 
specimens will be assessed for pathological response (MPR and pCR). In addition, exploratory biomarker 
analysis of surgical specimens (primary tumor tissue and dissected lymph node s) will be performed.",11,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 13 Before surgery, the investigator  will reassess the patient to reconfirm disease resectability. The presurgical 
visit and associated assessments should occur within 14  days of surgery and in accordance with local 
institutional practice .  
The surgical procedure should  be performed within 10 weeks from the first administered dose of study 
treatment. If surgery cannot be performed within this time window (eg, because of a prolonged AE), the 
medical monitor should be consulted. The investig ator and the medical monitor will determine the 
acceptable length of this time window. Complete resection (R0) should be performed . 
Disease  Follow -up Phase : 
Patients will continue adjuvant treatment and perform follow -up which will be  determined by  the 
investigator according to  the stage of dis ease and benefit -risk assessment  in accordance with the relevant 
clinical practice  (eg. Colon  and Rectal  Cancer NCCN  (National Comprehensive Cancer Network)  
guidelines , Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology ( CSCO )guideline ). Patients will continue to undergo 
tumor assessments following the original plan until the patient experiences disease progression  or 
recurrent according to RECIST  v 1.1, withdraws consent, is lost to follow up, death, begins  a new 
anticancer therapy or until the study terminates , whichever occurs first.  
Study Assessments:  
Patients with the diagnosis of Stage II -III colorectal cancer and  with unknown MSI and MMR status are 
required to provide bl ood and tumor tissues for central laboratory  confirmation  of MSI status during the 
prescreening period (defined as within 56 days prior to the first dose of the study drug) . Approximately 
2 mL peripheral whole blood together with tumor tissues (archival fo rmalin -fixed paraffin -embedded",12,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf

[FFPE] blocks or at least 10 freshly cut unstained slides) are required for central laboratory confirmation  
of MSI status.  
Patients with known MSI -H status by local laboratory  must  undergo central laboratory  assessment  of 
MSI-H during or after the screening period if tumor samples are obtainable. For patients with known 
dMMR status determined by local laboratory, central laboratory confirmation of MSI -H status will be 
performed during the screening period for enrollment. Approximately 2 mL peripheral whole blood 
together with tumor tissues (archival FFPE blocks or at least 10 freshly cut unstained slides) are required 
for central laboratory assessment/ confirmation of MSI -H. Available  paired tumor tissues  need t o be sent  
for retrospective analysis of other exploratory biomarkers related to response and resistance in sponsor  
designated central or test laboratory.  A fresh biopsy is mandatory in the absence of archival tumor tissues.  
Tumor imaging will be performed ≤ 28 days before first dose . During the study, tumor assessment will be 
performed after neo-adjuvant  treatment  and before surgery  (9 weeks ±  7 days after first dose ). After 
surgery, the post -surgery treatment and the follow up will determined by investigator . During this period 
tumor assessment will be performed every 12 weeks (±  14 days) for the first 3 years, and then every 24 
weeks (±  28 days) for a total 5 years, and then once  (±  28 days) each year thereafter based on RECIST

Analysis Sets:  
The Safety Analysis Set  (SAS)  includes all  enroll ed patients who received ≥ 1 dose of study drug; it will 
be the analysis set for the safety analyses.  
The Efficacy Analysis Set (EAS) includes all enrolled patients who receive neo-adjuvant  treatment 
followed by surgery. This will be the primary analysis se t for the efficacy analyses.  
Safety Analyses:  
Extent of exposure to each study drug will be summarized descriptively as the number of cycles received 
(number and percentage of patients), duration of exposure (days), cumulative total dose received per 
patient (mg), dose intensity, and relative dose intensity.

(ECGs), and the results of physical examinations will also be used to assess the safety profile. Descriptive 
statistics will be used to analyze all safety data in the SAS.  
Primary Efficacy Analysis:  
MPR rate is the primar y endpoint of the study. MPR rate is defined as the proportion of patients in the 
EAS with ≤ 10% residual viable tumor in the resected primary tumor after completion of neo-adjuvant  
therapy in an efficacy  analysis set.  The MPR rate will be summarized descr iptively, and the Clopper -
Pearson 95% confidence interval (CI) will be calculated to evaluate the precision of MPR estimate. The 
analysis of MPR rate will occur after all the patients in the efficacy analysis set have been assessed for

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19 1. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALES   
1.1. Background Information on Microsatellite Instability -High or 
Mismatch Repair Deficient Colorectal Cancer   
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common malignancy and the fifth leading cause of 
cancer death in China, with an estimation of 376.300 newly diagnosed cases and approximately 
191.000 deaths  in 2015  (Chen et al, 2016 ). Overall, the burden of CRC in China is relatively 
high. Moreover, the incidence of colorectal cancer continued to rise during the past 15 years  
(Zheng et al, 2018 ). Since 2004, t he cancer screening programs  promoted early detection and 
diagnosis  of CRC . One mass screening study demonstrated  that the detection ratio s of localized 
CRCs w ere 17.4%,  23% and 25.9% for Stage I, Stage II and Stage III respectively  (Lin et al, 
2019 ). The invasive cancers were found in  the majority of new diagnosed CRC s.  
Microsatellite instability (MSI) is characterized by alterations in the genome -wide microsatellite  
repeats, consisting of repeated sequences of 1 to 6 nucleotides (Yamamoto et al, 2020 ; Li et al, 
2020 ). It is a molecular tumor phenotype resulting from genomic hypermutability. The  gain or  
loss of nucleotides from microsatellite tracts - DNA elements composed of short repeating  motifs 
- is the diagnostic hallmark of MSI (De la Chapelle et al, 2010 ). These changes  can arise from 
impairments in the mismatch repair (MMR) system (Vilar et al, 2010 ; Oki et al, 1999 ). 
On the basis of mutation patterns, CRC can be categorized into two discrete groups: tumors that 
are a mismatch - repair -deficient (dMMR)or have high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI - 
H) (termed dMMR /MSI- H tumors) signature and high overall mutation burden and tumors that 
have a mismatch - repair -proficient (pMMR) and are microsatellite - stable  (MSS) or have low",18,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf
284,"H) (termed dMMR /MSI- H tumors) signature and high overall mutation burden and tumors that 
have a mismatch - repair -proficient (pMMR) and are microsatellite - stable  (MSS) or have low 
levels of microsatellite instability (MSI - L) (termed pMMR /MSI-L tumors)  signature with a 
much lower  mutation burden (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012 ). Importantly, MSI-
H/dMMR  tumors lead to a high tumor mutational burden, with highly immunogenic neoantigens 
arising from frameshift mutations. As a consequence, tumors of this subgroup are highly 
infiltrated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes in comparison with other CRCs  (Llosa et al, 2015 ; Marisa 
et al, 2018 ; Rosenbaum et al, 2016 ; Maby et al, 2015 ). 
Approximately 15-20% of all CRCs are MSI-H/dMMR . Germline mutations in MMR genes are 
found  in patients with Lynch syndrome  which is responsible for 2% -4% of colon cancer (CC) 
cases . Somatic defects in MMR gene function were reported occur  in approximately 19% of 
colorectal tumors  (NCCN Guidelines, 2021 ). MSI-H/dMMR  is more common in  localized 
cancer (10 –15% compared to 5% of metastatic CRC)  (André  et al, 2015 ; Chalabi et al, 2020 ) and 
Stage II disease may have  higher MSI-H frequency than Stage III disease  (22% vs. 12%)  (Roth 
et al, 2010 ).  
The presence of MSI-H/dMMR  disease is prognostic, as Stage II MSI-H/dMMR  tumors have a 
lower risk  of recurrence than Stage II pMMR /MSI- L tumors  (Popat et al, 2005 ). So MSI-
H/dMMR  status has been used in the adjuvant setting as a positive prognostic parameter and it is 
also used for therapeutic management because fluoropyr imidines alone are not indicated in the 
adjuvant setting for patients with Stage II  MSI-H/dMMR  CRC, given their favorable survival 
and the lack of impact of chemotherapy in this situation (Ribic  et al, 2003 ; Sargent et al, 2010 ).

cancers  (Llosa et al, 2015 ). These observations suggested  that MSI-H/dMMR  CRCs might 
respond well to  immune checkpoint blockade .  
1.2. Current Treatment of Resectable Stage II  and III Microsatellite 
Instability -High or Mismatch Repair Deficient Colorectal Cancer  
and Unmet Clinical Needs   
Currently , for patients w ith resectable Stage II -III CC, resection is the recommended modality, 
which includes laparoscopic and conventional colectomy with en bloc removal of the regional 
lymph nodes. Post -surgery, adjuvant therapy with a fluoropyrimidine alone is the standard of 
care for Stage I I CC harboring high -risk features. High -risk assessment should consider the 
potential risks of therapy compared to potential benefit including number of lymph nodes 
analyzed (less than 12), poor prognostic features (poor differentiation  [exclusive of those that are 
MSI-H], lymphatic or venous invasion, perineural invasion, obstruction and perforation, positive 
margins) and other comorbidities and anticipated life expectancy. For Stage  III diseases, 
combination therapy with  fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin for 3 –6 months is recommended as 
adjuvant therapy (Sobrero et al, 2020 ; Grothey et al, 2018 ; Iveson et al, 2019 ; NCCN Guidelines, 
2021 ). For patients with resectable Stage II -III rectal cancer, preoperative chemoradiation 
followed by radical surgery is recommended by International treatment guidelines (NCCN 
Guidelines, 2021 ).  
Data on neo-adjuvant  chemotherapy in CCs are limited. The phase 3 FOxTROT study 
(NCT00647530) provided useful data about such strategies for CC patients (Seymour et al, 
2019 ). In this randomized trial, 1052 patients with loc alized CC  were randomized to a",19,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf
287,"(NCT00647530) provided useful data about such strategies for CC patients (Seymour et al, 
2019 ). In this randomized trial, 1052 patients with loc alized CC  were randomized to a 
perioperative sequence (6 weeks of FOLFOX, then surgery, then 18 weeks of FOLFOX) or the 
standard strategy (surgery then 24 weeks of FOLFOX).  Neo-adjuvant  treatment was well 
tolerated and associated with evidence of histologi cal regression in 59% of patients (4% of 
pathological complete response  [pCR] ), histological downstaging and reduced rate of incomplete 
resections (5% vs. 10%). In this study a trend toward improved survival was found in patients 
receiving neo-adjuvant  chemotherapy. Importantly, FOXTROT was the first study to show that 
pathological response to neo-adjuvant  treatment in CCs is closely related to recurrence risk, with 
0% and 8% recurrences in patients with a pCR and marked regression, respectively, compared 
with 26% for patients with no regression. Based on these study results, the option for 
neo-adjuvant  therapy with FOLFOX and CAPEOX was added to the NCCN guidelines for the 
treatment of CC . Furthermore , important data from the FOxTROT study relating to the M MR 
status was reported: 95% of patients with dMMR tumors who received neo-adjuvant  
chemotherapy (n = 106) showed little or no response, and only 8.1% of patients with pMMR 
tumors (n = 592) had major pathological responses ( MPRs ) to neo-adjuvant  chemotherapy.  
With  the knowledge of the immuno genic microenvironment  in MSI-H/dMMR  tumor , several 
clinical trials  have demonstrated improved outcomes for patients with MSI-H/dMMR  in 
metastatic CRC  treated with inhibitors of PD -1(Le et al, 2016 ; Overman et al, 2017 ; Overman et 
al, 2018 ; Andre et al, 2018 ; Lenz et al, 2018 ). With these results, FDA granted approval for the 
PD-1 blocking antibodies, pembrolizumab and nivolumab  for the indication of MSI-H/dMMR  
metastatic CRC, respectively.",19,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 21 After these initial success es with MSI-H/dMMR  CRC in metastatic setting , the development of 
immune checkpoint inhibitors  (ICI) for early -stage  colorectal c ancer special ly as neo-adjuvant  
treatment also has demonstrated impressive tumor response. In the NICHE study , patients with 
early -stage CC received a neo-adjuvant  treatment with  ipilimumab plus nivolumab  before 
surgery (Chalabi et al, 2020 ). Strikingly, total all 21 dMMR CC patients had a pathological 
response, with 95% of MPRs  (≤10% of residual viable tumor in the surgical specimen), 
including 12 (60%) of pCRs . With a median follow -up of 8.1 months, all dMMR CC patients 
from the  NICHE study were alive and disease free . The treatment was well tolerated, and only 5  
patients (13%) wh o experienced Grade 3 or 4 treatment -related toxicity.   
Although MSI-H/dMMR  is a favorable prognostic feature in localized ( Stage I –III) CCs , T4 
stage and N2 stage are currently the best -known prognosticators for the MSI-H/dMMR  
population (Sinicrope et al, 2019 ; Sinicrope et al, 2013 ). In this population, the 3 -year disease -
free survival rates are approximately 60 –65% for T4 and/or N2 Stage II I tumors, compared to 
90% for l ow-risk MSI-H/dMMR  Stage II I CC patients.  There is an urgent need for therapeutic 
improvements for patients with high -risk Stage II I MSI-H/dMMR  CC. Furthermore , pathological 
response (pCR and marked regression ) to neo-adjuvant  treatment in CCs is closely related to 
recurrence risk . The neo-adjuvant  treatment may improve disease -free survival by reducing 
primary tumor burden before surgery. However, the clinical research of immune checkpoint 
inhibitors (ICI) for early -stage  colorectal cancer  was scar ce in China .

1.3. Background Information on Tislelizumab   
1.3.1.  Pharmacology   
Tislelizumab  is a humanized, immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) -variant monoclonal antibody against 
PD-1 under clinical development for the treatment of sever al human malignancies.  
Tislelizumab acts by binding to the extracellular domain of human PD -1 with high specificity as 
well as high affinity ([K D] = 0.15 nM). It competitively blocks binding efforts by both PD -L1 
and programmed cell death protein ligand -2 (PD-L2), thus inhibiting PD -1-mediated negative 
signaling in T cells. In in vitro cell -based assays, tislelizumab was observed to consistently and 
dose-dependently enhance the functional activity of human T cells and to preactivated, primary 
peripheral bl ood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ). In addition, tislelizumab has demonstrated 
antitumor activity in several allogeneic xenograft models, in which peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells were coinjected with human cancer cells (A431 [epidermoid carcinoma]) or 
tumor fragments (BCCO -028 [colon ca ncer]) into immunocompromised mice.  
Tislelizumab is an IgG4 -variant antibody to FcγR such as FcγRI and FcγRIIIA, and it has very 
low binding affinity to C1q , a subunit of complement 1 . In vitro assays  with tislelizumab  suggest 
either low or no ADCC , antib ody-dependent cellular phagocytosis  (ADCP)  or 
complement -dependent cytotoxicity  (CDC)  effects in humans  (Labrijn et al, 2009 ; Zhang et al,

nonclinical studies of tislelizumab.  
1.3.2.  Toxicology   
The toxicity and safety profile of tislelizumab was characterized in single -dose toxicology 
studies in mice and cynomolgus  monkeys and in a 13 -week repeat ed-dose toxicology study in 
cynomolgus monkeys. The tissue cross -reactivity was evaluated in the normal frozen tissues 
from both humans and monkeys. The cytokine release assays were also evaluated u sing fresh 
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells . The pivotal toxicology studies were conducted 
following GLP regulations. The single dosing regimens spanned from the intended human doses 
to 10 -fold higher than the maximum of the intended human doses, a nd the repeat dosing 
regimens spanned to 3 -fold higher than the maximum of the intended human doses. The 
cynomolgus monkey was the only relevant species based on the target sequence homology and 
binding activity.  
Overall, no apparent toxicity was noted in  mouse or monkey toxicity studies. No tissue cross  
reactivity was found in either human or monkey tissues, nor was any effect on cytokine release 
observed in the human whole -blood assay. The toxicokinetic profile was well characterized with 
dose proportion al increases in systemic exposure without apparent accumulation or sex 
difference. Immunogenicity was observed without apparent immunotoxicity or effect on the 
systemic exposure. The no-observed -adverse -effect -level  (NOAEL ) of tislelizumab in the 
13-week m onkey toxicity study was considered to be 30 mg/kg. The safety profile of 
tislelizumab is considered adequate to support the current study, BGB -A317 -214.

1.3.3.  Clinical Pharmacology   
Based on pooled data from 2596 patients across 12 clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic ( PK) of 
tislelizumab was best characterized using a 3 -compartmental linear population PK model with 
linear clearance mechanisms.  No time -varying clearance was observed in tislelizumab PK.  The 
Cmax and AUC increased in a nearly dose -proportional manner from 0.5 to 10  mg/kg.  The 
terminal t 1/2 was estimated to be approximately 23.8 days, and the steady state is expected to be 
reached in 12  weeks.  Tislelizumab PK was generally similar between Chinese patients and 
patients of other ethnic groups and across tumor types.  Please refer to the Tislelizumab

1.3.4.1.4.  Immune -Mediated Adverse  Events   
Anti-PD1 therapies are known to cause imAEs  in some patients , and therefore imAEs have been 
defined as AEs of special interest (AESI) in tislelizumab clinical studies and  as such are being 
reported expeditiously and they are being closely monitored.  
ImAEs are consistent with an immune -mediated mechanism or immune -mediated component for 
which noninflammatory etiologies (eg, infection or tumor progression) have been ruled ou t.  
ImAEs can include events with an alternate etiology which were exacerbated by the induction of 
autoimmunity.  There is a potential temporal relationship between the initiation of treatment with 
tislelizumab and onset of an imAE that spans several days to several months.  
All imAEs presented here are assessed as related to study drug by the investigator and 
categorized by the Safety/Pharmacovigilance team  of the sponsor .  Certain imAEs have multiple 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) te rms associated with the same 
category.  Special categories have been created to group patients experiencing these events.  
All imAEs that occurred in ≥ 2 patients with solid tumor in the total pooled monotherapy studies 
are shown in Table  2.

1.3.4.2.  Efficacy Assessment of Tislelizumab   
On 11 March 2022 , tislelizumab monotherapy in MSI -H/dMMR  metastatic solid tumor was 
approved under conditional approv al by the China National Medical Products Administration 
(NMPA)  based on the result of Study BGB -A317 -209.  
BGB -A317 -209 is a single -arm, multi -center, open -label, Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of tislelizumab (BGB -A317), an anti -PD-1 monoclonal antibody, as monotherapy in 
patients with previously -treated lo cally advanced unresectable or metastatic MSI-H or dMMR 
solid tumors. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is objective response rate ( ORR ) as 
assessed by the Independent Review Committee ( IRC) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors ( RECIST ) v1.1.  
As of 08 July 2021 , 80 patients  were enrolled (median age 53 years; range : 19-81 years)  and 
received at least one dose of tislelizumab.  Most patients had metastatic disease (98.8%), and the 
majority of patients had CRC (61.3%) . Of the 75 patients in the Efficacy Analysis Set,  ORR IRC was 
46.7% (n = 35; 95% confidence interval [ CI] 35.1 to 58.6) in all tumor types (1 -sided p < 0.0001), 
including 5 complete responses (CR) and 30 partial responses (PR). ORR IRC was 39.1% (n = 18; 
95% CI 25.1  to 54.6) in colorectal cancer (CRC) p atients  (N = 46), 55.6% (n = 5; 95% CI 21.2  to",29,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf

1.4. Study Rationales   
1.4.1.  Rationale for Tislelizumab as Neo-adjuvant  Treatment of Resectable 
Microsatellite Instability -High or Mismatch Repair Deficient CRC   
The promising antitumor activity of anti -PD-1 antibodies reported for metastatic and localized 
MSI-H/dMMR  CRC (see section  1.2).These outcomes have been attributed to the higher 
mutational burden of dMMR tumors, particularly the accumulation of insertions –deletions 
(indels), giving rise to more neoantigens ( Overman et al, 2018 ; Overman et al, 2017 ; Diaz et al, 
2015 ; Germano et al, 2017 ; Mandal et al, 2019 ). Possibly as a result of their higher neoantigen 
burden, dM MR tumors are also characterized by an increased density of intratumoral T cells 
(Fabrizio et al, 2018 ; Maby et al, 2015 ).  
With mass screening, more CRCs were diagnosed at their early -stage  and MSI-H is more 
common (10 –15%) in early stage CRCs compared to metastatic CRC (see Section 1.1). Treating",29,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 31 with immune checkpoint inhibit ors (ICI) ha ve showed higher response rates in early -stage 
disease compared with metastatic disease. T hat may be  attributed to a difference in T cell 
infiltration ( TCI), a lower degree of systemic immune suppression, the absence of visceral 
metastases and a lower tumor burden  (Blank et al, 2018 ; Forde et al, 2018 ). These biological 
features suggested that early stage  MSI-H/dMMR  CRCs might respond well to immune 
checkpoint blockade.  
Furthermore neoadjuvant therapeutic strategies have been successful in many gastro -intestinal 
cancer locations and the pathological response (pCR and marked regression) to neoadjuvant 
treatment in CCs is closely related to recurrence risk ( see Section  1.2) and may improve long -
term benefit. However according to FOxTROT study, the presence of MSI -H/dMMR disease 
demonstrated  the lack of impact of chemotherapy (see Section  1.2). 
Preliminary data from the ongoing Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies show that tislelizumab has been 
well tolerated in patients with advanced tumors in multiple solid and hematological  
malignancies. The safety profile for single -agent tislelizumab is similar to those observed in  
other PD -1 inhibitors (Tislelizumab Investigator’s B rochure ). 
Tislelizumab has been approved in China for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory 
classical Hodgkin lymphoma , for the treatment of patients with pretreated locally advanced or 
metastatic urothelial carcinoma with PD -L1 high expres sion and in  combination with Paclitaxel 
and Carboplatin as first -line treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous 
NSCLC . Tislelizumab is also being investigated for the treatment of patients with advanced 
cancers, including, but not limited to, NSCLC, esophageal carcinoma, gastric cancer, HCC , and",30,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf
308,"NSCLC . Tislelizumab is also being investigated for the treatment of patients with advanced 
cancers, including, but not limited to, NSCLC, esophageal carcinoma, gastric cancer, HCC , and 
MSI-H/dMMR  metastatic solid tumor  (Tislelizumab Investigator’s Brochure ). 
This study is a window of opportunity design, in which patients receiv e Tislelizumab as neo-
adjuvant  therapy between their cancer diagnosis and standard treatment (surgery). Patients are 
CRC treatment naï ve. Tumor biopsies before and after the investigational treatment are collected 
for translational research. This study des ign can enable detailed characteristics of the 
pharmacodynamic effects of Tislelizumab and the tumor biology. It offers a unique opportunity 
to study pharmacodynamic response in the setting of a tumor unperturbed by prior therapy and 
may improve the unders tanding of pharmacodynamic parameters and help to identify biomarkers 
for better patient selection.  
Given the promising antitumor activity of anti -PD-1 antibodies reported for metastatic and 
localized MSI-H/dMMR  CRC  and the biological features of localized  MSI-H/dMMR  CRC, 
Tislelizumab, an efficient PD -1 inhibitor as neo-adjuvant  treatment for resectable MSI-H/dMMR  
CRC may bring clinical benefit and warrant s further clinical development.  
1.4.2.  Rationale for Selection of Tislelizumab Dose  and Treatment Duration   
The clinical fixed dose of 200  mg intravenously once every 3  weeks was selected based on 
comparable safety and efficacy profiles between 2  and 5 mg/kg in BGB -A317_Study_ 001: 
• Rates of treatment -related AEs and SAEs observed in patients receiving 2  mg/kg and 
5 mg/kg once every 2  weeks and once every 3  weeks were comparable, suggesting no 
clear dose -dependence across these regimens.  Additionally, PK data also shows no 
relationship between exposure and treatment -emergent imAEs  (Wu et al, 2019a ; Wu 
et al, 2019b ).",30,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 32 • Confirmed response rates in patients treated with tislelizumab on a once every 
3 weeks schedule were favorable compared to those treated on a once every 2  weeks 
schedule.  While there are differences in response rates between dose levels, this is 
more likely a reflection of small sample size and patient heterogeneity than dose 
response.  
• Clearance of tislelizumab wa s not dependent on body weight, and the observed serum 
exposure of a 200  mg dose fell between serum exposure observed after 2  mg/kg and 
5 mg/kg doses. Therefore, clinical activity with a manageable and tolerable safety 
profile is expected to be maintained in patients receiving tislelizumab 200  mg once 
every 3  weeks.  
• Exposure -response analysis indicated that there was a lack of clinically significant 
exposure -response relationships for ORR and safety endpoints across a variety of 
advanced solid tumors and cl assical Hodgkin lymphoma for tislelizumab.  These 
findings support 200  mg once every 3  weeks dose regimen for pivotal studies.  
In conclusion, the observed clinical activity in patients with advanced tumors, coupled with a 
manageable safety profile and supp ortive data, support the proposed tislelizumab dose of 200  mg 
intravenously once every 3  weeks as the recommended dose for pivotal studies , please refer to 
the Tislelizumab Investigator’s Brochure . 
Three -cycle neo-adjuvant  treatm ent (9 weeks) with tislelizumab is selected  as planned treatment 
duration.  That is considering the minimum time to have treatment response with ICI therapy and 
to avoid potential surgery  delay .

310,"Biomarker analyses will be performed to explore the association of biomarkers with patient 
prognosis, response, and potential resistance to  tislelizumab as neo -adjuvant treatmen t.  
A number of biomarkers have been identified that correspond with response to immunotherapy 
for patients with dMMR  CRC in the neo-adjuvant  setting  by the Niche study  (Chalabi et al, 
2020 ). 
The NICHE study reports potentially predictive biomarker s as well as pharmaco dynamic 
biomarkers  (post -treatment versus  pre-treatment ) for response monitoring . 
For potentially predictive biomarkers : Tumor infiltrated immune cell analysis using multiplex 
immunofluorescence  have demonstrated the capability of immune cell infiltration in predicting 
response or resistance to anti-PD-1 therap ies. PD-L1 expression, TMB and GE P (various 
signatures ) have been reported to be correlated to the response to anti-PD-1 therapies (Miller et al, 
2019 ; Keung et al, 2020 ; Cristescu R et al, 2019 ; Marabell e A et al, 2020 ). No clear conclusions 
could be derived from  these biomarkers in  NICHE study  due to the limited number of patients  
Considering  the limited number of patients, the role of these biomarkers in predicting response to 
tislelizumab as neo-adjuvant  therapy  warrants further exploration.  Apart from their potential 
predictive value, GEP  and TMB  panels  can be designed to explore underlying resistance 
mechanism to guide potential combination strategies . In summary, the role of immune cell 
infiltration, PD-L1 expression, TMB /DNA mutation  and GEP in predicting response/resistance to 
tislelizumab as neo -adjuvant treatment  will be investigated .",31,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 33 For pharmaco dynamic biomarkers  (post -treatment versus pre -treatment) for response monitoring : 
In NICHE study, enhanced CD8+ T cell infiltration  and IFN γ score  (pooled from the GEP panel)  
were observed post treatment in dMMR CRC  patients , indicating  the potential role of immune cell 
infiltration  and GEP in identif ying pharmaco dynamic biomarkers for response monitoring. The 
pharmaco dynamic change  of PD -L1 expression and TMB /DNA mutation  were not reported by the 
Niche study, and their role as pharmaco dynamic  biomarkers can be  further explor ed. 
Consequently, immune cell infiltration , PD-L1, TMB /DNA mutation and GEP can be explored 
in paired tumor samples  (pre-treatment and post-treatment)  to identify their potential predictive 
value, their potential role in response monitoring, as well as resistance mechanisms in patients 
who receive tislelizumab as neo -adjuvant therapy in MSI -H/dMMR  CRC patients.  
1.5. Benefit -Risk Assessment   
The promising antitumor activity of anti -PD-1 antibodies in treating MSI-H/dMMR  CRC  was 
reported  (see Section 1.2). These outcomes have been attributed to the higher mutational burden 
and more neoantigens of dMMR tumors  (see Section 1.4.1 ). Possibly as a result of their higher 
neo-antigen burden, dMMR tumors are also characterized by an increased density of 
intratumoral T cells.  MSI-H/dMMR  is more common in localized cancer (10 –15% compared to 
5% of met astatic CRC) (see Section  1.1). Treat ment  with ICIs has shown higher response rates 
in early -stage disease compared with metastatic disease. This has been attributed to a difference 
in TCI, a lower degree of systemic immune suppression, the absence of visceral metastases and a 
lower tumor burden  (see Section 1.4.1 ) 
MSI-H/dMMR  CRC has a favorable prognostic feature in localized ( Stage I–III) disease.",32,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf
312,"lower tumor burden  (see Section 1.4.1 ) 
MSI-H/dMMR  CRC has a favorable prognostic feature in localized ( Stage I–III) disease. 
However, there is still an unmet need for therapeutic improvement s for patients with high -risk 
early -stage  MSI-H/dMMR  CRC (see Section  1.2).   
Furthermore , neo-adjuvant  therapeutic strategies have been successful in many gastro -intestinal 
cancer locations and the pathological response (pCR and marked regression) to neo-adjuvant  
treatment in CCs is closely related to recurrence risk (Seymou r et al, 2019 ). This treatment 
strategy for early -stage MSI-H/dMMR  CRCs may improve long -term benefit. In China, the 
clinical research of ICI for early -stage CRC  was scar ce.  
Preliminary data from the ongoing Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies show that tislelizu mab has been  
well tolerated in patients with advanced tumors in multiple solid and hematological  
malignancies. The safety profile for single -agent tislelizumab is similar to that observed in  other 
PD-1 inhibitors. Two pivotal Phase 2 studies demonstrated c linical meaningful benefit. The 
initial data collected in other studies suggest that tislelizumab can result in antitumor activity 
across a variety of tumor types. Antitumor activity has been observed across the dose ranges 
evaluated in patients. Therefore , the benefit -risk profile for tislelizumab monotherapy appears to 
be favorable in oncology population based on preliminary efficacy and safety data  Tislelizumab

recurrence, providing neo-adjuvant  treatment with  ICIs and refine therapeutic strategies for 
early -stage MSI -H/dMMR CRCs, is  an urgent unmet need. Given the promising antitumor 
activity of anti -PD-1 antibodies reported for metastatic and localized MSI-H/dMMR  CRC, the 
biological features of localized MSI-H/dMMR  CRC, introducing  tislelizumab , an PD -1 inhibitor 
as neo-adjuvant  treatm ent for resectable MSI-H/dMMR  CRC may bring clinical benefit and 
warrants further research.

This is an  open -label,  multicenter Phase 2 study designed to investigate the preliminary efficacy 
and safety of tislelizumab monotherapy as neo-adjuvant  treatment in approximately 38  patients 
with early -stage (Stage II -III) MSI -H or dMMR  CRC .  
The study consists of a screening phase  (and/or prescreening phase) , a treatment phase that 
includes a neo-adjuvant  phase, surgery , and a disease  follow -up phase.    
The study schema is presented in Figure 1.

For all study procedures see Section  7 and Appendix  1.  
3.2. Prescreening Period   
Patients  with unknown MSI and MMR status  are required to provide blood and tumor tissue s for 
central laboratory confirmation of MSI status during the prescreening period (defined as within 
56 days prior to the first dose of the study drug). A separate prescreening informed consent must 
be obtain ed. Refer to Section  7.1 and Section  7.7 for details.  
3.3. Screening Period   
Screening evaluations will be performed within 28 days  before first dose . Patients who agree to 
participate in this study will sign the informed consent form (ICF) before  undergoing any 
screening procedure. Patients who are suspected to have a serious respiratory concurrent illness 
or who exhibit significant respiratory sympto ms unrelated to the underlying cancer will also take 
a pulmonary function test (refer to Section  7.2.4  and Appendix  1 for details). Screening 
evaluations may be repeated as needed within the screening period; the investigator will assess

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 38 3.4. Treatment Perio d  
Neo-adjuvant  Phase:  
After completing all screening activities, patients confirmed to be eligibl e by the investigator will 
receive tislelizumab 200 mg intravenously once every 3 weeks for 3 cycles.   
During the neo-adjuvant  phase, patients who are found to have disease progression at scheduled 
tumor assessments (before Cycle 3 and surgery) or at any t ime during neo-adjuvant  treatment , 
and whose tumors are still deemed resectable and non -metastatic , will proceed to receive surgery 
if amenable and will remain eligible for all on -study evaluations based on investigator’s 
judgement.  
Patients who discontinu e neo-adjuvant  treatment early because of urgent surgery (eg., because of 
intestinal obstruction, intestinal perforation, or intestinal bleeding), disease progression or 
intolerable AEs and who do not proceed to have a complete resection will proceed to re ceive 
other treatment as determined by the investigator. Further in -clinic study procedures for these 
patients should be discussed with the medical monitor.  
Surgery:  
Upon completion of neo-adjuvant  therapy, patients will undergo surgical resection of their 
tumor. Surgical specimens will be assessed for pathological response (MPR and pCR). In 
addition, exploratory biomarker analysis of surgical specimens (primary tumor tissue and 
dissected lymph node s) will be performed.  
Before surgery, tumor imaging and assessment will be performed within 9 weeks ±  7 days after 
first dose , and the investigator  will reassess the patient to reconfirm disease resectability. The 
surgical procedure should be performed wit hin 10 weeks from the first administered dose of 
study treatment. If surgery cannot be performed within this time window (eg, because of a 
prolonged AE), the medical monitor should be consulted. The investigator and the medical",37,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf

prolonged AE), the medical monitor should be consulted. The investigator and the medical 
monitor will determine the a cceptable length of this time window. Complete resection (R0) 
should be performed . 
Disease  Follow -up Phase:  
Patients will continue adjuvant treatment and perform follow -up which will be determined by the 
investigator according to the stage of disease and benefit -risk assessment in accordance with the 
relevant clinical practice (eg. Cancer NCCN guidelines, CSCO guideline). Patients will continue 
to undergo tumor assessments  based on RECIST v1.1, which will be performed every 12 weeks 
(±  14 days)  for the first 3 years, and then every 24 weeks (±  28 days) for a total  of 5 years, and 
then once each year (± 28 days) thereafter. Patients will continue with the scheduled tumor 
assessments until the patient experiences disease progression or recurren ce according to RECIST 
v 1.1, withdraws consent, is lost to follow up, death, begins a new anticancer therapy  (excluding 
adjuvant therapy) , or until the study terminates, whichever occurs first.  
Safety will be assessed throughout the study by monitoring AEs/S AEs (toxicity grades  assigned 
per NCI-CTCAE v5.0 ) and laboratory results. Vital signs, physical examinations, ECOG PS 
change, electrocardiogram ( ECG ) results, and other examinations will also be used for safety 
assessment. Safe ty assessments are further detailed in Section  7.5 and in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Appendix  1).",37,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf

The End -of-Treatment Visit (EOT)/Safety Follow -up will be conducted as follows:  
EOT/ Safety Follow -up 1: Patients who received surgery will be asked to return to the clinic for 
the EOT/Safety Follow up Visit (to occur within 30 days [±  7 days] after the surgery, or before 
the initiation of a new anticancer treatment, whichever occurs first ).   
EOT/ Safety Follow -up 2: Patients who discontinued pre -operative treatment for any reason and 
for whom surgery will not be conducted will be asked to return to the clinic for the EOT/ Safety 
Follow -up Visit (to occur within 30  days [±  7 days] after the last dose of study treatment, or 
before the initiation of a  new anticancer treatment, whichever occurs first ). 
If routine laboratory tests (eg, hematology, serum chemistry) are completed within 7  days before 
the EOT/Safety Follow -up visit, these tests need not be repeated.  Tumor assessment is not 
required at the EOT/Safety Follow -up, and should follow the regular schedule of assessment s as 
outlined  in Section  7.6. 
In addition, telephone contacts with patients s hould be conducted to assess imAEs and 
concomitant medications (if appropriate, ie, associated with an imAE or is a new anticancer 
therapy) at 60  days and 90  days (±  14 days) after the last dose of study drug, regardless of 
whether the patient starts a new  anticancer therapy.  If patients report a suspected imAE at a 
telephone follow -up contact, the investigator should arrange an unscheduled visit if further 
assessment is indicated.  
All AEs, including SAEs, will be collected as described in Section 8.6.

5.1. Formulation, Packaging, and Handling   
Tislelizumab is a monoclonal antibody formulated for intravenous injection in a single -use vial 
(20R glass, United States Pharmacopeia  [USP]  Type I), containing a total of 100  mg of antibody 
in 10 mL of isotonic solution. Tislelizumab has been aseptically filled in single -use vials with a 
Flurotec-coated butyl rubber stopper and an aluminum cap. Each vial is packaged into a single 
carton box.  
The contents of the label will be in accordance with all applicable local regulatory requirements.  
The study drug must be kept at the temperature and condition s as specified on the label. Shaking 
should be avoided.  
Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for details regarding intravenous administration, accountability, 
and disposal. Please also refer to the Tislelizumab Investigator’s Broch ure for other details 
regarding tislelizumab.  
5.2. Dosage, Administration, and Compliance   
Tislelizumab 200 mg will be administered on Day 1 of each 21 -day cycle (once every 3  weeks) 
for 3 cycles  before surgery.  
Tislelizumab will be administered by intravenous infusion through an intravenous line 
containing a sterile, non -pyrogenic, low -protein -binding 0.2 or 0.22 micron in -line or add -on 
filter.  Specific instructions for product prep aration and administration are provided in the 
Pharmacy Manual.  
As a routine precaution, after infusion of tislelizumab on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, patients 
must be monitored for at least 60 minutes afterward in an area with resuscitation equipment and

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 47 within 14 days of surgery and in accordance with local institutional practice. Pre -operative 
evaluation should be performed per local standard of care (including, but not limited to, blood 
tests, organ function tests [as indicated ], and other evaluation procedures ). 
The surgical procedure should be performed in accordance with the relevant local guidance 
and/or clinical practice within 10 weeks after the  first dose of neo-adjuvant  study treatment as 
best as possible. If surgery cannot be performed within this time window (eg,  because of a 
prolonged AE), the investigator and the medical monitor will determine the acceptable length of 
this time window.  
The performed surgical procedu re should be documented and reported in the eCRF. If, after 
neo-adjuvant  treatment or during the operation, the surgeon determines that the patient should 
not proceed with the planned surgery, the reason should be documented and reported in the 
eCRF as wel l. 
5.4. Incorrect Administration or Overdose   
Any overdose of tislelizumab (defined as ≥ 600 mg in a 24 -hour period) should be recorded in 
the patient’s chart and on the appropriate eC RF. AEs associated with an overdose or incorrect 
administration of study drug will be recorded on the AE eCRF. Any SAEs associated with an 
overdose or incorrect administration are required to  be reported within 24  hours of awareness via

5.6.1.  Dose Interruptions or Delay for Study Drugs   
A dose interruption is an interruption of an infusion.  A dose delay is a deviation from prescribed 
dosing schedu le (ie, the drug is withheld beyond visit window).  
Every effort should be made to administer the study drug according to the planned dose and 
schedule.  In the event of significant toxicities, dosing may be delayed and/or interrupted  based 
on the guidelines below.  Reasons for dose interruptions or delays,  the supportive measures 
taken, and the outcome will be documented in the patient's chart and recorded in the eCRF.  
Tislelizumab treatment may be temporarily suspended if the patient experiences a toxicity that is 
considered related to tislelizumab and req uires a dose to be withheld. Tislelizumab treatment 
should resume as soon as possible after the AEs recover to baseline or Grade 1 (whichever is 
more severe).  If the administration of study drug can resume within ≤  10 days, it should be 
administered in th e current cycle.  If the study drug needs to be withheld for >  10 days, it should 
be omitted from the current cycle and administration should continue at the start of the next 
cycle.

Day 1 of Cycle  1, these tests should be repeated and reviewed before study drug administration. 
After Cycle  1, these laboratory tests  are to be  performed and  reviewed within 48  hours before 
study drug adm inistration.  
Thyroid assessments will be performed as specified in  Appendix  1. 
Details about sample collection and shipment will be provided in a sepa rate instruction manual. 
Investigators should use results from the same local laboratories for assessing eligibility, safety

Although immune -mediated myocarditis is a rare complication of immune CPIs , serum 
creatinine kinase ( CK) and CK cardiac isoenzyme  (CK-MB) is monitored in all tislelizumab 
studie s to protect the study patients and to quantify the risk of muscle inflammation (see  
Appendix  1 for the blood collection schedule and Appendix  7 for guidelines for management of 
suspected immune -mediated myocarditis).  
If CK-MB fractionation is not available, serum troponin (troponin I and/or T) measurements will 
be performed instead per local guidelines , and used consistently throughout the study.

HCV antibody is positive, an HCV RNA test will be triggered.  
7.6. Tumor and  Response Evaluations   
Tumor imaging will be performed within 28  days before first dose of study drug.  Results of 
standard -of-care tests or examinations performed prior to obtain ing informed consent and 
≤ 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug may be used for the purposes of screening rather 
than repeating the standard -of-care tests.  
Before surgery, patient s will undergo computed tomography (CT) scans (with oral/intravenous  
contrast, unless contraindicated) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck , chest, pelvi s, 
and abdomen within 9 weeks ±  7 days after first dose  to reconfirm resectability . Other known or 
suspected sites of disease must be included in the imaging assessments (bone, brain, etc).  
After surgery, disease follow -up tumor assessment will be performed by CT or MRI (including 
neck , chest, pelvis , and abdomen) every 12 weeks (±  14 d ays) for the first 3 years, then every 
24 weeks (±  28 days) for a total of 5 years, and then once each year (±  28 days) thereafter based 
on RECIST v1.1. Patients will continue with the scheduled tumor assessments until the patient 
experiences disease progr ession or recurren ce according to RECIST v 1.1, withdraws consent, is 
lost to follow up, death, begins a new anticancer therapy  (excluding adjuvant therapy ), or until 
the study terminates , whichever occurs first.  
All measurable and evaluable lesions should  be assessed and documented at the Screening Visit 
and reassessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation.  The same radiographic procedure used to 
assess disease sites at Screening is required to be used throughout the study (eg, the same 
contrast protocol fo r CT scans).",54,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf

• Screening evaluations will be performed within 28 days before first dose . 
• If a patient is known to have a contraindication to CT contrast media or develops a 
contraindication during the study, a noncontrast CT scan of the chest plus a 
contrast -enhanced MRI (if possible) of the abdomen should be performed.  
• If a CT scan for tumor assessment is performed on a PET/CT scanner, the CT 
acquisition must be consistent with the standards of a diagnostic CT scan.  
Response will be assessed by the investig ator using RECIST v1.1 (see Appendix  4).

Shipping, storage, and handling of blood, archival tumor, fresh tumor, and leftover tumor tissue 
for the assessment of biomarkers will be managed through a central laboratory. R efer to the 
laboratory manual for details of sample handling and the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix  1) 
for timepoints.  
During the prescreening period, patients with unknown MSI and MMR status are required to  
provide blood and tumor tissues for central laboratory confirmation  of MSI status.

Approximately 2 mL peripheral whole blood together with tumor tissues (archival FFPE blocks 
or at least 10 freshly cut unstained slides) are required  for central laboratory 
assessment/ confirmation of MSI -H. Available  paired tumor tissues  (pretreatment and post -
treatment  tumor tissues  as FFPE  blocks or approximately 14 [≥  10] freshly cut unstained slides ) 
need to be sent for retrospective analysis of other exploratory biomarkers related to response and 
resistance for all patients in a BeiGene -designated central or test laboratory . These exploratory 
biomarkers include immune cell infiltration , PD-L1, TMB/DNA mutation, and GEP for all 
enrolled patients .  
A fresh tumor biopsy at a tumor lesion is mandatory if there are no available pre-treatment 
archival tumor samples . Written patient consent is required for fresh tumor biopsies.  
For fresh biopsies, acceptable samples include core needle biopsies for nonsuperficial tumor 
tissue or excisional, incisional, pun ch, or forceps biopsies for cutaneous, subcutaneous, or 
mucosal lesions. Tumor tissue should be of good quality based on total and viable tumor content. 
Fine-needle aspiration, brushing, cell pellets from pleural effusion, and lavage samples are not 
accept able.  Approximately 2 mL of peripheral whole blood will be required for collection to 
work as the MSI test control.

acceptable time window is specified. Assessments scheduled on the day of study treatment 
administration (Day 1) of each cycle should be performed before any  study treatment 
infusion/dose unless otherwise noted. Laboratory result s are required to be reviewed before  
dosing.  
If the timing of a protocol -mandated study visit coincides with a holiday, weekend, or other 
events, the visit should be scheduled on the nearest feasible date (the visit window is provided in  
Appendix  1), with subsequent visits conducted according to the planned schedule every 3  weeks

The investigator is responsible for th e monitoring and documentation of events that meet the 
criteria and definition of an AE or SAE as provided in this protocol.  
8.1. Risks Associated With Study Drugs   
8.1.1.  Risks Associated With Tislelizumab   
Tislelizumab is an investigational agent that is currently in clinical development. The following 
recommendation is based on results from nonclinical and clinica l studies with tislelizumab and 
published data on other molecules within the same biologic class.  
The PD -L1/PD -1 pathway is involved in peripheral immune tolerance; therefore, such therapy 
may increase the risk of imAEs, specifically the induction or exace rbation of autoimmune 
conditions.  AEs observed with anti -PD-1 therapy are presented in Section  8.7.3 . 
Although most imAEs observed with immunomodula tory agents have been mild and 
self-limiting, such events should be recognized early and treated promptly to avoid potential 
major complications.  Suggested evaluation and management guidelines for suspected imAEs are 
provided in Appendix  7. 
8.2. General Plan to Manage Safety Concerns   
8.2.1.  Eligibility Criteria   
Eligibility criteria were selected to guard the safety of patients in this stu dy. Results from the 
nonclinical toxicology studies and clinical data with  tislelizumab, as well as the 
nonclinical/clinical data from other PD -L1/PD -1 inhibitors, were considered. Specifically, 
patients at risk for study -emergent active autoimmune disease s, with a history of autoimmune 
diseases that may relapse, who have undergone allogenic stem -cell or organ transplantation or 
who have received a live viral vaccine ≤ 28 days before first dose  are excluded from the study.

Refer to Section  4.2 for the full list of exclusion criteria.  
8.2.2.  Safety Monitoring Plan   
Safety will be evalua ted in this study through the monitoring of all AEs, defined and graded 
according to NCI-CTCAE  v5.0. 
All enrolled patients will be evaluated clinically and with standard laboratory tests at regular 
intervals during their participation in this study. Safety evaluations will consist of medical 
interviews, recording of AEs (see Table  5), physical examinations, laboratory measurements 
(hematology, clinical chemistry, etc), and other assessments including those listed in  
Appendix  1. In addition, patients will be closely monitored for the development of any signs or 
symptoms of autoimmune conditions or infection.  
At the start of each cycle, the study drug will  be administered only after clinical laboratory 
results have been reviewed. Administration of study drug will be performed in a setting where 
emergency medical equipment and staff who are trained to respond to medical emergencies are 
available (for additio nal information, see Section  5.2).",56,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf

The potential safety issues anticipated in this study, as well as measures intended to avoid or 
minimize such toxicities, are outlined in Section  8.7.  
8.3. Adverse Events   
8.3.1.  Definitions and Reporting   
An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of the 
study drug, whether considered related to  the study drug or not.  
Examples of AEs include:  
• Worsening of a chronic or intermitten t pre-existing condition, including an increase in 
severity, frequency, duration, and/or an association with a significantly worse 
outcome  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after administration  of study drug  even though 
the condition might  have been pr esent before the start of the study drug 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either the study 
drug or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not  be reported as an AE or 
SAE)  
When an AE or SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory results, and diagnostic reports) relative to 
the AE or SAE. The investigator will then  record all relevant information regarding an AE or 
SAE in the eCRF. However, there may be instances when copies of the medical records for 
certain cases are requested by the sponsor. In this instance, all patient identifiers will be blinded 
on the copies of the medical records before  submission to the sponsor.  
8.3.2.  Assessment of Severity

SAEs should be assessed and graded based upon NCI-CTCAE v5.0 . 
Toxicities that are not specified in NCI -CTCAE will be defined as follow s: 
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated  
• Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living  
• Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening;

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 59 • Grade 4: Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention  indicated  
• Grade 5: Death related to AE  
Note: The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous. Severity is a measure of intensity 
(for example, grade of a specific AE, mild [Grade 1], moderate [Grade 2], severe [Grade 3], or 
life-threatening [Grade 4 ]), whereas seriousness is classified by the criteria based on the 
regulatory definitions. Seriousness serves as the guide for defining regulatory reporting 
obligations from the sponsor to applicable regulatory authorities as described in Section  8.6.2 . 
8.3.3.  Assessment of Causality   
The investigator is obligated to assess the relatio nship between the study drug s and the 
occurrence of each AE or SAE, using their best clinical judg ement. Alternative causes, such as 
natural history of the underlying disease, concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the 
temporal relationship of the AE  or SAE to the study drug s should be considered and investigated. 
The investigator should consult the Tislelizumab Investigator’s Brochure  in the determination of 
his/her assessment.  
There may be situations when an SAE has occurred, and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the sponsor. However, it is very important that the 
investigator always assesses  causality for every SAE before transmission of the SAE report to 
the sponsor, because  the causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining 
regulatory reporting requirements. The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality after 
considering follow -up information, amending th e SAE report accordingly.  
The causality of each AE should be assessed and classified by the investigator as “related” or 
“not related.” An AE is considered related if there is “a reasonable possibility” that the AE may",58,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf
359,"The causality of each AE should be assessed and classified by the investigator as “related” or 
“not related.” An AE is considered related if there is “a reasonable possibility” that the AE may 
have been caused by the study drugs (ie, there are facts, evidence, or arguments to suggest 
possible causation). A number of factors should be considered in making this assessment, 
including:  
• Temporal relationship of the AE to the administration of study treatment/study 
procedure  
• Whe ther an alternative etiology has been identified  
• Mechanism of action of the study drug s  
• Biological plausibility  
An AE should be considered “related ” to study drug s if any of the following criteria are met, 
otherwise the event should be assessed as “not related ”: 
• There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out  
• There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors is 
unlikely",58,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf

reasonable time after administration of the study drug) , however, the influence of 
other factors may have contributed to the AE (eg, the patient’s clinical condition or 
other concomitant AEs)  
8.3.4.  Follow -up of Adverse Events   
After the initial AE or SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each patient 
and provide further information to the sponsor on the pati ent’s condition.  
All AEs and SAEs documented at a previous visit/contact and designated as ongoing will be 
reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts.  
All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution, the condition stabilizes or is considered 
chronic, the AE  or SAE is otherwise explained, the patient is lost to follow -up, or the patient 
withdraws consent. The investigator will ensure that follow -up includes any supplemental 
investigations as may be indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. 
This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, 
radiographic imaging, or consultation with other health care professionals.  
The sponsor may request that the investigator perform or arrange for the con duct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible the nature and/or causality of 
the AE or SAE. The investigator is obligated to assist. If a patient dies during participation in the 
study or during a recognized follow -up period, the sponsor will be provided with a copy of any 
postmortem findings, including histopathology.  
New or updated information should be reported to the sponsor according to the SAE instructions 
provided by the sponsor within the time frames outlined  in Section  8.6.2 .

361,"provided by the sponsor within the time frames outlined  in Section  8.6.2 . 
8.3.5.  Laboratory Test Abnormalities   
Abnormal laboratory findings (eg, clinical chemistry, complete blood count, coagul ation, or 
urinalysis) or other abnormal assessments (eg, ECGs, X-ray, or vital signs) that are judged by the 
investigator as clinically significant will be recorded as AEs or SAEs. This includes clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are present at 
baseline and significantly worsen during the study. The definition of clinically significant is left 
to the judg ement of the investigator. In general, these are the laboratory test abnormalities or 
other abnormal as sessments that:  
• are associated with clinical signs or symptoms, or  
• require active medical intervention, or  
• lead to dose interruption or discontinuation, or  
• require close observation, more frequent follow -up assessments, or further diagnostic 
investigati on.  
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (eg, alkaline 
phosphatase and bilirubin 5 ×  ULN associated with cholestasis), only the diagnosis (ie, 
cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.",59,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf

Protocol Amendment  2.0 25 July 2022  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 61 If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard 
definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the AE. For example, an elevated serum 
potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia.”  
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should 
not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF unless the etiology changes. The initial 
severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or se riousness should be updated any 
time the event worsens.  
8.4. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event   
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life-threatening  
Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an AE in 
which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the AE. It does not refer to an AE, 
which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more sever e.  
• Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
Note: In general, hospitalization signifies that the patient was admitted (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) to the hospital or emergency ward for 
observation and/or treat ment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s 
office or outpatient setting.  
• Results in disability/incapacity  
Note: The term “disability ” means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition i s not intended to include experiences 
of relatively minor medical significance, such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle), which may 
interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do  not constitute a substantial 
disruption.

safety reports from the sponsor in the investigator site file. 
8.6.3.  Eliciting Adverse Events   
The investigator or designee will ask patients about AEs by asking the following standard 
questions:  
• How are you feeling?  
• Have you had any medical problems since your last visit?  
• Have you taken any new medicines since your last visit?  
8.6.4.  Disease Progression   
Disease progression , which is expected in this study population and measured as an efficacy 
endpoint, should not be recorded as an AE term. Similarly, nonserious AEs that are cl early 
consistent with the pattern of progression of the underlying disease and are considered 
unequivocally due to disease progression should not be recorded. However, if there is any 
uncertainty as to whether a nonserious AE is due to disease progression,  it should be recorded as 
an AE.  All SAEs and deaths , regardless of relatedness to disease progression , should be 
recorded and reported (see Section  8.6.2 ).   
8.6.5.  Deaths   
Death is an outcome and not usually considered an event. If the only information available is 
death and the cause of death is unknown, then the death is reported  as an event  (eg, “death,” 
“death of unknown cause,” or “death unexplained ”). 
8.6.6.  Pregnancies   
If a female patient or the partner of a male patient becomes pregnant while receiving st udy drugs 
or within 120  days after the last dose of study drugs, a pregnancy report form is required to be 
completed and expeditiously submitted to the sponsor to facilitate outcome follow -up. 
Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwa rded to the sponsor. Generally, 
follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8  weeks following the estimated delivery date. Any 
premature termination of the pregnancy will be reported .",63,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf

premature termination of the pregnancy will be reported .  
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE, any pregnancy complication or elective 
termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or SAE.  
An abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous should be always rep orted as an 
SAE. Similarly, any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a patient exposed to the 
study drug should be recorded and reported as an SAE.  
8.6.7.  Expedited Reporting to Health Authorities, Investigators, Institutional Review 
Boards, and Ind ependent Ethics Committees

8.6.8.  Assessing and Recording Immune -Mediated Adverse Events   
Since treatment with anti -PD-1 can cause autoimmune disor ders, AEs considered by the 
investigator to be immune -mediated (Section  8.7.3 ) should be classified as imAEs  and identified 
as such in the eCRF AE page until Day 90 after the last dose of the study drug.  
Investigators should consult the guidance on diagnostic evaluation and management of imAEs 
which are commonly seen with immune CPIs  in Appendix  7. 
An extensive list of potential imAEs is presented in Section  8.7.3 , Table  7. All conditions similar 
to those listed should be evaluated to determine whether they are imAEs, based on a similar 
diagnostic process to those reactions that are presented in more detail in Appendix  7. 
8.6.9.  Recording Infusion -Related Reactions   
The symptoms of infusion -related reactions may include but are not limited to fever, chills/rigor, 
nausea, pruritus, angioedema, hypotension, headache, bronchospasm, urticaria, rash, vomiting, 
myalgia, dizziness, or hypertension. Severe reactions may include acute respiratory dis tress 
syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, or cardiogenic shock. Each individual 
sign and symptom of an infusion -related  reaction should be recorded as a separate AE in the 
eCRF and identified as an infusion -related reaction. Refer to  the eCRF completion guidelines for 
details.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 67 8.7.2.  Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions and Flu -Like Symptoms   
If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the patient must be treated according to the best available 
medical practice as described in the complete guideline for emergency treatment of anaphylacti c 
reactions as outlined in  the Working Group of the Resuscitation Council (U nited Kingdom ) Soar 
et al, 2008 ). Patients should be instructed to report any delayed reactions to the investigator 
immediately.  
In the event of a systemic anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction , the infusion must be stopped 
immediately, and the patient must be discontinued from the study. Systemic 
anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions  typically manifest within minutes after administration of 
the drug/antigen, an d are characterized by respiratory distress , laryngeal edema , and/or intense 
bronchospasm , vascular collapse or shock without antecedent respiratory difficulty , cutaneous 
manifestations such as pruritus and urticaria with/without edema , and/or gastrointestinal 
manifestations such as nausea, vomiting, crampy abdominal pain, and diarrhea.  
The patient will be administered epinephrine injection and dexamethasone infu sion if 
hypersensitivity reaction is observed and should then be placed on monitor immediately . An 
Intensive Care Unit should be alerted for possible transfer if needed.  
For prophylaxis of flu -like symptoms, a dose of 25  mg indomethacin or a comparable dos e of 
nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (ie, 600  mg ibuprofen, 500  mg naproxen sodium) may be 
administered 2  hours before and 8  hours after the start of each dose of study drugs  infusion. 
Alternative treatments for fever (ie, paracetamol) may be administ ered to patients at the 
discretion of the investigator.

375,"Alternative treatments for fever (ie, paracetamol) may be administ ered to patients at the 
discretion of the investigator.  
8.7.3.  Immune -Mediated Adverse Events   
Immune -mediated AEs are of special interest in this study. If the events listed below or si milar 
events occur, the investigator should exclude alternative explanations (eg, combination drugs, 
infectious disease, metabolic, toxin, disease progression or other neoplastic causes) with 
appropriate diagnostic tests, which may include but are not limi ted to serologic, immunologic, 
and histologic (biopsy) data. If alternative causes have been ruled out , the AE required the use of 
systemic steroids, other immunosuppressants, or endocrine therapy and is consistent with an 
immune -mediated mechanism of acti on, the imAE indicator in the eCRF AE page should be 
checked.  
A list of potential imAEs is shown below in  Table  7. All conditions similar to those listed should 
be evaluated in patients receiving tislelizumab to determine whether they are immune -mediated.  
Recommendation for diagnostic evaluation and management of imAEs  is based on European 
Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 
guidelines (Haanen et al, 2017 ; Brahmer et al, 2018 ), and common immune -mediated toxicities 
are detailed in Appendix  7. For any AEs not included in  Appendix  7, please refer to the ASCO

The pCR rate is defined as the proportion of patients in the EAS with absence of residual tumor 
in the resected prima ry tumor and all resected lymph nodes after completion of neo-adjuvant  
therapy followed by surgery assessed by investigator. The pCR rate will be summarized 
descriptively , and a Clopper -Pearson 95% CI will also be calculated.  
EFS is defined as the time fro m the time of first dose until any of the following events  in the 
EAS , whichever occurs first: radiographic disease progression according to RECIST v1.1, local 
or distant recurrence, or death due to any cause. The median and other quartiles of EFS will be

a.  Patient s with unknown MSI and MMR status are required to provide blood and tumor tissues for central confirmation of MSI status during  the prescreening 
period (defined as within 56 days prior to the first dose of the study drug ). A separate prescreening informed c onsent must be obtained for central 
assessment  of microsatellite instability  for patients with unknown MMR  and MSI status  during the prescreening period. Written informed consent is 
required prior to performing any study -specific tests or procedures  during  the screening period .  Results of standard -of-care tests or examinations performed 
prior to obtaining informed consent and within 28 days prior to the first dose may be used for screening assessments rather than repeating such tests.  
b. The presurgical visi t and associated assessments should occur within 14 days of surgery and in accordance with local institutional practices. The surgical 
procedure should be performed within 10 weeks from the first administered dose of study treatment as best as possible . If surgery cannot be performed 
within this time window (eg, because of a prolonged AE), the medical monitor should be consulted.  (see Section  3.4 . 
c.  The EOT Visit /Safety Follow -up is conducted when the investigator determines that study treatment will no longer be used, or all the study treatment is 
completed (Section  3.5).  If routine laboratory tests (eg, hematology, serum chemistry) are completed within 7 days before the End of Treatment Visi t, tests 
need not be repeated.   
d. Includes age or year of birth, gen der, and self -reported race/ethnicity; history of clinically significant disease, surgery, or cancer history; reproductive status",91,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf

d. Includes age or year of birth, gen der, and self -reported race/ethnicity; history of clinically significant disease, surgery, or cancer history; reproductive status 
(ie, of childbearing potential or no childbearing potential); history of alcohol consumption and tobacco (ie, former or curre nt or never ), and all medications 
(eg, prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used within 30 days before the first dose ).  
Information on radiographic studies performed prior to study entry may b e collected for review by the investigator.  
e.  Vital signs collected on study include temperature, pulse rate, and blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) while the patient  is in a seated position after resting 
for 10 minutes.  The patient’s vital signs are  required to be recorded within 60 minutes before, during, and approximately 30 minutes after the first 2 cycles 
of tislelizumab  infusion .  For subsequent infusions, vital signs will be collected within 60 minutes before infusion and, if clinically indicat ed, during and 
30 minutes after the infusion. Height should only be measured and recorded during screening.  Weight will be measured before study drug administration in 
every cycle.  
f.  During the Screening Visit, a complete physical examination will be conduc ted. At subsequent visits (and as clinically indicated), limited, 
symptom -directed physical examinations will be performed.  
g. The ECG recordings will be obtained during screening, the Safety Follow -up Visit, and as clinically indicated at other timepoints.  Patients should be 
resting in a semi -recumbent supine position for at least 10 minutes prior to each ECG collection.  
h. The AEs and laboratory abnormalities will be graded per NCI -CTCAE v5.0. All AEs will also be evaluated for seriousness. After the informed  consent",91,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf
418,"h. The AEs and laboratory abnormalities will be graded per NCI -CTCAE v5.0. All AEs will also be evaluated for seriousness. After the informed  consent 
form has been signed, but prior to the first administration of study drug, only SAEs should be recorded. After the first dose of study drugs, all AEs and 
SAEs, regardless of their assessed relationship to study drug, are to be reported until eithe r 30 days after the last dose of study treatment or the initiation of 
new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first. In addition, telephone contacts with patients should be conducted to assess i mmune -mediated AEs and 
concomitant medications (if appropriate, ie, associated with an immune -mediated AE or is a new anticancer therapy) at 60 days, and 90 days (±  14 days) 
after the last dose of study treatment, regardless of whether the patient starts a new anticancer  therapy. Immune -mediated AEs (serious or nonserious) will 
be reported until 90 days after the last dose of study treatment, regardless of whether the patient starts a new anticancer t herapy.  The investigator should 
report any SAEs that are assessed as rel ated to tislelizumab treatment, at any time after treatment discontinuation.  
i.  Local laboratory assessments on serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis will be conducted, of which certain elements will be collected as 
specified in Appendix  2.  If laboratory tests at Screening are not performed within 7  days of first dose, these tests should be repeated and reviewed before 
dosing.  Hematolo gy and serum chemistry (including liver function tests) will be performed weekly for the first 3  cycles.  After Cycle  1, results are to be 
reviewed within 48  hours before study drug administration.  Urinalysis is to be conducted during the treatment period  only if clinically warranted.  Refer to

troponin T may be tested instead.   
j. Urine or serum pregnancy test (for women of childbeari ng potential, including women who have had a tubal ligation) must be performed and documented 
as negative within 7 days prior to the first dose.  Urine pregnancy tests will be performed at each visit prior to dosing, an d at the EOT/Safety Follow -up 
Visit. A serum pregnancy test must be performed if the urine pregnancy test is positive or equivocal.  
k. Analysis of FT3, FT4, and TSH will be performed by a central laboratory or the local study site laboratory.  If the test s at Screening are not performed 
within 7  days of first dose, these tests should be repeated and reviewed before dosing. Thyroid function tests will be performed at Screening, during  
neo-adjuvant  treatment , presurgical visit, and at the Safety Follow -up Visit.  
l. Testing will be performed by the loc al laboratory at Screening and will include HBV/HCV serology (HBsAg, HBsAb, HBcAb, and HCV antibody). If 
HBsAg or HBcAb is positive, then an HBV DNA test will be triggered. If HCV antibody is positive, an HCV RNA test will be trig gered.

n. Patients with unknown MSI and MMR status are required to  provide blood and tumor tissues for central laboratory confirmation  of MSI status during the 
prescreening period. Approximately 2 mL peripheral whole blood together with tumor tissues (archival FFPE blocks or at least 10 freshly cut unstained 
slides) are required for central laboratory confirmation  of MSI status. Patients with known MSI -H status by local laboratory must  undergo  central laboratory 
assessment  of MSI -H during or after the screening period if tumor samples are obtainable. For patients with known dMMR status determined by loc al 
laboratory, central laboratory  confirmation of MSI -H status will be performed during screening  period for enrollment. Approximately 2 mL peripheral 
whole blood together with tumor tissues (archival FFPE blocks or at least 10 freshly cut unstained slides) are required  for central laboratory 
assessment/ confirmation of MSI -H. Avai lable  archival pre-treatment FFPE blocks or approximately 14  [≥ 10] freshly cut unstained slides need to  be sent

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 96 APPENDIX  4. THE RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA IN SOLID 
TUMORS (RECIST) GUIDELINES, VERSION 1.1   
The text below was obtained from the following reference: Eisenhaue r et al, 2009 . 
DEFINITIONS  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this trial using the international criteria proposed 
by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee (v1.1).  Changes in 
only the largest diameter (uni -dimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the 
RECIST criteria.  
Note: Lesions are eith er measurable or non -measurable using the criteria provided below.  The 
term “evaluable” in reference to measurability will not be used because it does not provide 
additional meaning or accuracy.  
Measurable Disease  
Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
• 10 mm by CT scan and MRI (no less than double the slice thickness and a minimum 
of 10  mm)  
• 10 mm caliper measurement by clin ical exam (when superficial)  
• 20 mm by chest X -ray (if clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung)  
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must be ≥  15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT sc an slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5  mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will 
be measured and followed.  
Nonmeasurable Disease  
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter ≥ 10 to <  15 mm 
with conventional techniques or <  10 mm using spiral CT scan), are considered nonmeasurable 
disease.  Leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural, or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast 
disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal  masses/abdominal organomegaly",95,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf

disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal  masses/abdominal organomegaly 
identified by physical examination that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques are 
all non -measurable.  
Bone lesions:  
• Bone scan, PET scan, or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques 
to measure bone lesions.  However, these techniques can be used to confirm the 
presence or disappearance of bone lesions.  
• Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging tec hniques such as CT 
or MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets 
the definition of measurability described above

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 97 Cystic lesions:  
• Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they 
are, by definition, simple cysts  
• Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they me et the definition of measurability described above.  However, if 
non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as 
target lesions.  
Lesions with prior local treatment:  
• Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other 
loco-regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been 
demonstrated progression in the lesion.  Trial protocols should detail the conditions 
under which such lesions would be considered mea surable.  
Target Lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2  lesions per organ and 5  lesions in total, should be 
identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be 
selected on the basis of their size (lesio ns with the longest diameter), be representative of all 
involved organ, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor.  Pathological nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of 
≥ 15 mm by CT scan.  Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum.  
The short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by radiologists to judge if a node is 
involved by solid tumor.  Nodal size is normally reported as 2  dimensions in the plane in which",96,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf
427,"The short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by radiologists to judge if a node is 
involved by solid tumor.  Nodal size is normally reported as 2  dimensions in the plane in which 
the image is obtained (for CT scan, this is  almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of 
acquisition may be axial, sagittal, or coronal).  The smaller of these measures is the short axis.  
For example, an abdominal node which is reported as being 20  mm × 30 mm has a short axis of 
20 mm and q ualifies as a malignant, measurable node.  In this example, 20  mm should be 
recorded as the node measurement.  All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥10  mm 
but < 15  mm) should be considered nontarget lesions.  Nodes that have a short axis < 1 0 mm are 
considered nonpathological and should not be recorded or followed.  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph  nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.",96,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 98 Nontarget Lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required and 
these lesions should be followed as “present” , “absent”, or in rare cases “unequivocal 
progression” (more details to follow).  In addition, it is possible to record multiple nontarget 
lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the case record form (eg, “multiple enlarged 
pelvic lymph node” or “multiple liver metastases”).  
GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATION OF MEASURABLE DISEASE  
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed.  All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatm ent start and never 
more than 4  weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.  Imaging based evaluation  should 
always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are accessible by clinical examination.  
Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
and P10  mm diameter as assessed using calipers (eg, skin nodules).  For the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by color photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is 
suggested.  As noted above, when lesions can be evaluated by both clinical  examination and 
imaging, imaging evaluation should be undertaken since it is more objective and may also be 
reviewed at the end of the trial.  
• Chest X -ray: Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression is 
an important endpoint, sinc e CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in",97,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf
429,"• Chest X -ray: Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression is 
an important endpoint, sinc e CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in 
identifying new lesions.  However, lesions on chest X -ray may be considered 
measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  
• CT, MRI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure 
lesions selected for response assessment.  This guideline has defined measurability of 
lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5  mm or less.  
When CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5  mm, the minimum size for a 
measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in 
certain situations (eg, for body scans).  
• Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be 
used as a method of measu rement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in 
their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator 
dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be 
taken from one assessment to t he next.  If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in 
the course of the study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised.  If there is concern 
about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.",97,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 99 • Endoscopy, laparoscopy: The ut ilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, they can be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials 
where recurrence following complete response (C R) or surgical resection is an 
endpoint.  
• Tumor markers: Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor 
response.  If markers are initially above the upper normal limit, however, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in CR.  Becau se tumor markers are disease 
specific, instructions for their measurement should be incorporated into protocols on a 
disease specific basis.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent 
ovarian cancer) and prostate -specific antigen response (in recurrent prostate cancer), 
have been published.  In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed 
CA-125 progression criteria which are to be integrated with objective tumor 
assessment for use in first -line trials in ovarian cancer.  
• Cytolo gy, histology: These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and 
CR in rare cases if required by protocol (for example, residual lesions in tumor types 
such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  When 
effusions are  known to be a potential adverse effect of treatment (eg, with certain 
taxane compounds or angiogenesis inhibitors), the cytological confirmation of the 
neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment can be 
considered if the mea surable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease in 
order to differentiate between response (or stable disease) and progressive disease.

Evaluation of Target Lesions  
• Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions .  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to 
< 10 mm. 
• Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters  
• Progressiv e Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum 
if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum 
must a lso demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5  mm.  (Note: the appearance 
of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).  
• Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study  
• Lymph nodes: Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual 
short axis measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the 
baseline examination), even if the node s regress to below 10  mm on study.  This 
means that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the “sum” of lesions",98,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf

having a short axis of <  10 mm.  Case report reco rded in a separate section where, in 
order to qualify for CR, each node must achieve a short axis <10  mm.  For PR, SD 
and PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of 
target lesions.  
• Target lesions that become “too sma ll to measure”.  While on study, all lesions (nodal 
and non -nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded 
at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (eg, 2  mm).  However, 
sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are reco rded as target lesions at baseline 
become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an 
exact measure and may report them as being “too small to measure”.  
When this occurs, it is important that a value be recorded on the e CRF.  If it is the 
opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement 
should be recorded as 0  mm.  If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen 
but too small to measure, a default value of 5  mm should be assig ned (Note: It is less 
likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since they usually have a definable 
size when normal and are frequently surrounded by fat such as in the 
retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present and is fai ntly 
seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5  mm should be assigned in this 
circumstance as well).  This default value is derived from the 5  mm CT slice 
thickness (but should not be changed with varying CT slice thickness).  The 
measurement of t hese lesions is potentially non -reproducible, therefore providing this 
default value will prevent false responses or progressions based upon measurement",99,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf
433,"measurement of t hese lesions is potentially non -reproducible, therefore providing this 
default value will prevent false responses or progressions based upon measurement 
error.  To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure, 
that should be recorded, even if it is below 5  mm. 
• Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment : When non -nodal lesions “fragment”, the 
longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the 
target lesion sum.  Similarly, as lesions coalesc e, a plane between them may be 
maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each 
individual lesion.  If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer 
separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal 
longest diameter for the “coalesced lesion”.  
Evaluation of Nontarget Lesions  
While some nontarget lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and 
instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points speci fied in the protocol.  
• CR: Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level.  
All lymph nodes must be nonpathological in size (<10  mm short axis).  
• PD: Unequivocal progression (as detailed below) of existing nontarget lesions.  
(Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.)  
• Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more nontarget lesion(s) and/or maintenance 
of tumor marker level above the normal limits",99,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf

Protocol Amendment  2.0 25 July 2022  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 101 • When the patient also has measurable disease : In this setting, to achieve “unequivocal 
progression” on the basis of the nontarget disease, there must be an overall level of 
substantial worsening in nontarget disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in 
target disease, the overall tumor burden ha s increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy.  A modest “increase” in the size of one or more nontarget 
lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.  The 
designation of overall progression solely on the b asis of change in nontarget disease 
in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.  
• When the patient has only non -measurable disease:  This circumstance arises in some 
phase  3 trials when it is not a criterion of trial entry to h ave measurable disease.  The 
same general concept applies here as noted above, however, in this instance there is 
no measurable disease assessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in 
non-measurable disease burden.  Because worsening in non -target disease cannot be 
easily quantified (by definition: if all lesions are truly non -measurable) a useful test 
that can be applied when assessing patients for unequivocal progression is to consider 
if the increase in overall disease burden based on the change in non -measurable 
disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare 
PD for measurable disease: ie, an increase in tumor burden representing an additional 
73% increase in “volume” (which is equivalent to a 20% incre ase diameter in a 
measurable lesion).  
• Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from “trace” to “large”, an 
increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may be described in",100,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf
435,"measurable lesion).  
• Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from “trace” to “large”, an 
increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may be described in 
protocols as “sufficient to require a change in ther apy”.  If “unequivocal progression” 
is seen, the patient should be considered to have had overall PD at that point.  While 
it would be ideal to have objective criteria to apply to non -measurable disease, the 
very nature of that disease makes it impossible to do so, therefore the increase must 
be substantial.  
New Lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some 
comments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for the 
identificatio n of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be 
unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging 
modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some “new” 
bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre -existing lesions).  This is particularly 
important when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or CR.  For example, necrosis of a 
liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a “new” cyst ic lesion, which it is not.  
A lesion identified on a follow -up trial in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline 
is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. An example of this is the patient 
who has visceral disease at baseline and while on trial has a CT or MRI brain ordered which 
reveals metastases. The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of PD even if 
he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.",100,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf

Protocol Amendment  2.0 25 July 2022  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 102 If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow -up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease.  If repeat scans confirm there 
is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.  
While fluorode oxyglucose (FDG) -PET response assessments need additional study, it is 
sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning 
in assessment of progression (particularly possible “new” disease).  New lesions on the basis o f 
FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up, is a sign of PD based on 
a new lesion.  
• No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up: If the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is 
PD.  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease 
on CT, additional follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly 
progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial 
abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a 
pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic 
images, this is not PD.  
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The BOR is the best response recorded from the start of the study drug treatment until the end of 
treatment taking into account any requirement for confirmation.  On occasion a response may not 
be documented until after the end of therapy so protocols should be clear if post -treatment 
assessments are to be considered in determination of BOR.  Protocols must specify how any new 
therapy introduced before progression will affect best response designat ion.  The patient’s BOR",101,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf
437,"assessments are to be considered in determination of BOR.  Protocols must specify how any new 
therapy introduced before progression will affect best response designat ion.  The patient’s BOR 
assignment will depend on the findings of both target and nontarget disease and will also take 
into consideration the appearance of new lesions.  Furthermore, depending on the nature of the 
trial and the protocol requirements, it ma y also require confirmatory measurement.  Specifically, 
in non -randomized trials where response is the primary endpoint, confirmation of PR or CR is 
needed to deem either one the “best overall response”.  
The BOR is determined once all the data for the pati ent is known.  Best response determination 
in trials where confirmation of complete or partial response IS NOT required: Best response in 
these trials is defined as the best response across all time points (for example, a patient who has 
SD at first assess ment, PR at second assessment, and PD on last assessment has a BOR of PR).  
When SD is believed to be best response, it must also meet the protocol specified minimum time 
from baseline.  If the minimum time is not met when SD is otherwise the best time poi nt 
response, the patient’s best response depends on the subsequent assessments.  For example, a 
patient who has SD at first assessment, PD at second and does not meet minimum duration for 
SD, will have a best response of PD.  The same patient lost to follo w-up after the first SD 
assessment would be considered inevaluable.",101,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf

Abbreviations: CR, complete response; NE, not evaluable; PD, progressive disease; PR, partial response; SD, stable 
disease.  
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to “normal” 
size (<  10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans.  This measurement should 
be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to overstate progression should  it be 
based on increase in size of the nodes.  As noted earlier, this means that patients with CR may 
not have a total sum of “zero.”  
In trials where confirmation of response is required, repeated ""NE"" time point assessments may 
complicate best response d etermination.  The analysis plan for the trial must address how 
missing data/assessments will be addressed in determination of response and progression.  For 
example, in most trials it is reasonable to consider a patient with time point responses of 
PR-NE-PR as a confirmed response.  
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration”.  Every effort should be made to document objective progression 
even after discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an 
objective response: it is a reason for stopping trial therapy.

439,"objective response: it is a reason for stopping trial therapy.  
Conditions that define “early progression, early death, a nd inevaluability” are trial specific and 
should be clearly described in each protocol (depending on treatment duration, treatment 
periodicity).  
In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue.  
When the evaluat ion of CR depends upon this determination, it is recommended that the residual 
lesion be investigated (fine needle aspirate/biopsy) before assigning a status of CR.  FDG -PET 
may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases  where a 
residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.  The use of 
FDG -PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol and supported 
by disease specific medical literature for the indication.  Ho wever, it must be acknowledged that 
both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy 
resolution/ sensitivity.",102,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 104 For equivocal findings of progression (eg, very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic changes, 
or necrosis  in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled assessment.  If at 
the next scheduled assessment, progression is confirmed, the date of progression should be the 
earlier date when progression was suspected.  
CONFIRMATORY MEASUREMENT/D URATION OF RESPONSE  
Confirmation  
In nonrandomized trials where response is the primary endpoint, confirmation of PR and CR is 
required to ensure responses identified are not the result of measurement error.  This will also 
permit appropriate interpretation  of results in the context of historical data where response has 
traditionally required confirmation in such trials.  However, in all other circumstances, ie, in 
randomized trials (phase 2 or 3) or trials where stable disease or progression are the primary  
endpoints, confirmation of response is not required since it will not add value to the 
interpretation of trial results.  However, elimination of the requirement for response confirmation 
may increase the importance of central review to protect against bia s, in particular in trials which 
are not blinded.  
In the case of SD, measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after trial entry at a 
minimum interval (in general not less than 6 weeks).  
Duration of Overall Response  
The duration of overall r esponse is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for 
CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is 
objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest meas urements 
recorded on study).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR 
until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.  
Duration of Stable Disease",103,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf
441,"The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR 
until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.  
Duration of Stable Disease  
Stable disease is measured from th e start of the treatment (in randomized trials, from date of 
randomization) until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest sum on 
study (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is the reference for calculation of PD).  
The cl inical relevance of the duration of stable disease varies in different studies and diseases.  If 
the proportion of patients achieving stable disease for a minimum period of time is an endpoint 
of importance in a particular trial, the protocol should specif y the minimal time interval required 
between 2 measurements for determination of stable disease.  
Note: The duration of response and stable disease as well as the progression -free survival are 
influenced by the frequency of follow -up after baseline evaluation.  It is not in the scope of this 
guideline to define a standard follow -up frequency.  The frequency should take into account 
many parameters including disease types and stages, treatment periodicity, and standard practice.  
However, these limita tions of the precision of the measured endpoint should be taken into 
account if comparisons between trials are to be made.",103,data/BGB\BGB-A317-214 Protocol Amendment 2.0 EN with signature.pdf

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 107 APPENDIX  7. IMMUNE -MEDI ATED ADVERSE EVENT EVALUATION 
AND MANAGEMENT   
The recommendations below for the diagnosis and management of any immune -mediated AE 
(imAE)  are intended as a guidance.  This documen t should be used in conjunction with expert 
clinical judgement (by specialist physicians experienced in the treatment of cancer using 
immunological agents), and individual institutional guidelines or policies.  
The c riteria used to diagnose imAEs include bl ood tests, diagnostic imaging, histopathology, and 
microbiology assessments to exclude alternative causes such as infection, disease progression, 
and adverse effects of concomitant drugs.  In addition to the results of these tests, the following 
factors sh ould be considered when making an imAE diagnosis:  
• What was the temporal relationship between initiation of tislelizumab administration 
and the adverse event?  
• How did the patient respond to withdrawal of tislelizumab?  
• Did the event recur when tislelizumab was reintroduced?  
• Was there a clinical response to corticosteroids?  
• Is the event an autoimmune endocrinopathy?  
• Is disease progression or an alternative diagnosis a more likely explanation?  
When alternative explanations to autoimmune toxicity have been excluded, the imAE field 
associated with the AE in the eCRF should be checked.

OF “WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING POTENTIAL,” “NO 
CHILDBEARING POTENTIAL”   
Contraception Guidelines  
The Clinical Trials Facilitation Group’s recommendations related to contraception and 
pregnancy testing in clinical trials include the use of highly effective forms of birth control.  
These methods include the following:  
• Combined ( estrogen - and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with the inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, or transdermal)  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with the inhibition of ovulation 
(oral, injectable, or implanta ble) 
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Vasectomized male partner, provided that the vasectomized partner is the sole sexual 
partner of the woman of childbearing potential study participant and t hat the 
vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of surgical success.  
• Sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the 
entire period of exposure associated with the study treatment).  
− NOTE: Total sexual abstinence should only be used as a contraceptive method if 
it is in line with the patient’s usual and preferred lifestyle.  Periodic abstinence 
(eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods), declaration of 
abstinence for the duration of exposure to study drug, and withdrawal are not 
acceptable methods of contraception.  
Of note, barrier contraception (including male and female condoms with or without spermicide) 
is not considered a highly effective method of contraception and if used, this  method must be 
combined with a highly effective form of birth control, listed above.

Definitions of “Women of Childbearing Potential,” “Women of No Childbearing Potential”  
As defined in this protocol, “women of childbearing potential” are female patients who are 
physiologically capable of becoming pregnant.  
Conversely, “women of no childbearing potential” are defined as female patients meeting any of 
the following criteria:  
• Surgically sterile (ie, through bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, o r 
hysterectomy)  
• Postmenopausal, defined as:

and all alternative medical causes for the lack of spontaneous menses for ≥ 12 
months have been ruled out, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome, 
hyperprolactinemia, etc.  
If an FSH measurement is required to confirm postmenopausal state, concomitant use of 
horm onal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy should be excluded.

COLLABORATION (CKD -EPI) EQUATION   
In adults, the most widely -used equations for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from 
serum creatinine are the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD -EPI) Levey 
et al, 2009 ) equation and the Modi fication of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation.  National 
Kidney Disease Education Program calculators rely on creatinine determinations which are 
isotope dilution mass spectrometry traceable.  All laboratories should be using creatinine 
methods calibrat ed to be isotope dilution mass spectrometry traceable.  
The CKD -EPI equation calculator should be used when serum creatinine (S cr) reported in mg/dL.  
This equation is recommended when estimated GFR values above 60 mL/min/1.73  m2 are 
desired.  
GFR = 141 ×  mi n (S cr/κ, 1)α ×  max(S cr/κ, 1)-1.209 ×  0.993Age ×  1.018 [if female] ×  1.159 [if black]  
where:  
Scr is serum creatinine in mg/dL,  
κ is 0.7 for females and 0.9 for males,  
α is -0.329 for females and -0.411 for males,  
min indicates the minimum of S cr/κ or 1, an d 
max indicates the maximum of S cr/κ or 1.  
The equation does not require weight because the results are reported normalized to 1.73  m2 
body surface area, which is an accepted average adult surface area.
